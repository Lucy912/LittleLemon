## SCENE 1: Hook (0:00-0:15)
**Slide:** Split screen - bad AI output vs amazing AI output

The difference between "AI is useless" and "AI is magic" is five words. Actually, five parts. I'll show you which five parts in the next eight minutes. And once you know this, you'll never get bad AI outputs again.

## SCENE 2: Promise (0:15-0:45)
**Slide:** "What You'll Learn" with 3 bullets

Here's what you're learning today. First, why most AI prompts fail. You're probably making these same mistakes right now. Second, the Five-Part Framework that works every single time. And third, how to apply it to any task you can think of.

After this video, you'll be able to turn vague ideas into precise prompts, get consistent high-quality AI outputs, and never stare at a blank prompt box wondering what to type.

## SCENE 3: Why Most Prompts Fail (0:45-2:00)
**Slide:** Examples of bad prompts with X marks

Let me show you why most prompts fail. Here's a common bad prompt: "Help me with marketing." What's wrong? It's too vague. There's no context. There's no desired format. The result? Generic, useless output that doesn't help you at all.

Another bad prompt: "Write a blog post." What's missing? Topic specifics. Audience definition. Tone guidance. The result is bland, robotic content that sounds like AI wrote it.

One more: "Analyze this data." What's wrong? No analysis goal. No output structure. No actionability requirement. You get surface-level insights that don't lead to decisions.

Here's the problem. AI needs structure. Without structure, it guesses. And when it guesses, it guesses wrong. The solution? Give AI exactly what it needs to succeed. That's what the Five-Part Framework does.

## SCENE 4: Part 1 - Role & Part 2 - Task (2:00-3:30)
**Slide:** Framework diagram highlighting Role and Task

Let's break down the framework. Part one: Role. Who should AI be? This matters because AI adopts expertise and perspective. It shapes the knowledge it draws from. It influences language and depth.

Good role examples. "Act as a marketing strategist." "Act as a data analyst with ten years experience." "Act as a teacher explaining to beginners." "Act as a CFO reviewing a proposal."

Bad role examples? "You are AI." That's too generic. Or no role at all, which means AI picks randomly. Quick tip: match the role to your needs. Technical task? Technical role. Creative task? Creative role.

Part two: Task. What exactly do you want? This defines the deliverable. It sets clear boundaries. It prevents scope creep.

Good task examples. "Write a three-hundred-word product description." "Create a five-step process for onboarding." "Analyze these fifty customer reviews and identify the top three complaints."

Bad task examples? "Help with product." What kind of help? "Do something with reviews." What output do you want? Quick tip: use action verbs. Write, create, analyze, summarize, list, compare, design, plan.

## SCENE 5: Part 3 - Context (3:30-4:30)
**Slide:** Context examples with surrounding information graphics

Part three: Context. Why does this matter? Context provides background AI cannot guess. It influences the relevance of your output. It enables nuanced responses.

Good context examples. "This is for a B2B SaaS company selling to CFOs. Our main differentiator is security." Or, "I'm presenting to a skeptical board who thinks AI is overhyped. I need data-driven arguments." Or, "Budget is tight at five hundred dollars, timeline is urgent at two weeks, team is non-technical."

Bad context examples? No context at all, which means AI makes assumptions. Or too much context with irrelevant details that confuse the AI.

Quick tip: answer these questions. Who's this for? What constraints exist? What's the goal? Usually two to four sentences is perfect.

**[Word count: 145 words]**

## SCENE 6: Part 4 - Format & Part 5 - Tone (4:30-6:00)
**Slide:** Format and Tone examples with visual representations

Part four: Format. How should it look? This defines structure and organization. It makes output immediately usable. It prevents reformatting work.

Good format examples. "Format: table with three columns. Feature, benefit, pricing." Or, "Format: executive summary in three sentences, then five bullet points, then recommendation." Or, "Format: email with subject line, greeting, three paragraphs, call to action, sign-off."

Bad format examples? "Make it look good." That's subjective. Or no format specified, which means AI picks randomly. Quick tip: be specific. Table, list, paragraph, email, report, code, JSON, whatever you need.

Part five: Tone. How should it sound? This matches your brand or voice. It sets appropriate formality. It influences emotional resonance.

Good tone examples. "Tone: conversational but professional, warm and encouraging." "Tone: direct and data-driven, confident but not arrogant." "Tone: friendly and casual, like talking to a friend over coffee." "Tone: formal and authoritative, appropriate for legal context."

Bad tone examples? "Sound good." That's subjective. "Be nice." That's vague. Or no tone at all, which means AI defaults to neutral and boring.

Quick tip: describe it like you would to a writer. Professional, casual, witty, serious, warm, direct.

## SCENE 7: Framework in Action - Before & After (6:00-7:15)
**Slide:** Side-by-side comparison with live demo

Now let me show you this framework in action. Let's write a marketing email. Here's a bad prompt: "Write an email about our new product." Watch what happens. The result is generic, boring, completely unusable.

Now here's a good prompt using the Five-Part Framework. Role: act as a marketing copywriter known for concise, benefit-focused messaging. Task: write a product launch email. Context: we're launching an AI-powered scheduling tool for busy executives. Main benefit saves five hours per week. Target audience is C-level execs at tech companies. They're skeptical of "another tool." Format: subject line, preview text, three short paragraphs with two to three sentences each, single clear CTA button text. Tone: confident but not salesy, data-driven, acknowledging their skepticism.

Look at the difference. The output is specific. It's on-brand. It's ready to use. You could send this with minimal editing. That's the power of the Five-Part Framework.

## SCENE 8: Recap & Practice Challenge (7:15-8:00)
**Slide:** Framework summary with icons and call-to-action

Let me recap the Five-Part Framework. Part one: Role. Who should AI be? Part two: Task. What exactly do you want? Part three: Context. Why does this matter? Part four: Format. How should it look? Part five: Tone. How should it sound?

Use this framework for everything. Writing like emails, content, and documents. Analysis like data, feedback, and reports. Planning like projects, strategies, and processes. Problem-solving like brainstorming, decisions, and solutions.

Here's your challenge. Take one prompt you used this week that gave you bad results. Rewrite it with the Five-Part Framework. Watch the quality transform.

Download the Framework Cheat Sheet. It's a one-page reference with examples for each part and a template to fill in.

In the next video, you'll write your first ten prompts. Hands-on practice. Leave a comment and tell me: what's the first prompt you'll improve?

Thanks for watching. I'll see you in the next video.
