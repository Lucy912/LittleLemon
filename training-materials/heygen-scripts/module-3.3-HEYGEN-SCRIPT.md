## SCENE 2: Why You Need an AI Policy (0:15-1:00)
**Slide:** "With vs Without Policy" comparison

The reality without a policy: team members unsure what's allowed, inconsistent practices where some are safe and some are risky, security incidents waiting to happen, no defense if something goes wrong, legal and compliance exposure.

With a clear policy: everyone knows the rules, consistent safe practices, reduced risk of data leaks, legal protection showing due diligence, faster AI adoption because clarity removes fear.

Who needs a policy? Companies of any size, even two-person startups. Freelancers working with client data. Teams in regulated industries. Anyone handling sensitive information. Organizations that want to move fast safely.

Good news: you don't need lawyers or compliance teams. You need clear, practical guidelines that fit on two to three pages. Let me show you how.

## SCENE 3: The 8 Essential Components - Part 1 (1:00-2:30)
**Slide:** Components 1-4 with icons

A good AI policy answers eight questions. Question one: which tools are approved? Covers specific AI tools allowed like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini. Free versus paid tiers. Personal accounts versus company accounts. Enterprise tools for sensitive data. Tools that are not allowed and why. Why it matters: prevents team from using risky, unapproved tools.

Example policy language: "Approved tools: ChatGPT Plus or Enterprise, company accounts only. Claude Pro, company accounts only. Free tiers allowed for brainstorming and non-sensitive work only, not allowed for client data or proprietary info. Enterprise tools required for sensitive data. Prohibited tools: browser extensions that inject AI, unknown or unvetted AI tools."

Question two: what data can and cannot be shared? Covers the Never List from Video Three-One. How to anonymize data properly. Examples specific to your industry. Consequences of violations. Why it matters: prevents data leaks and compliance violations.

Example: "Never share in AI: customer PII, proprietary code, credentials, financial data, anything under NDA. Anonymization required: remove all names, generalize locations and dates, test whether someone could identify the person or company."

Question three: when is AI use required versus optional? Covers tasks where AI accelerates work, tasks where human judgment is required, tasks where AI is prohibited. Why it matters: sets clear expectations, prevents over-reliance.

Example: "Encouraged AI use: first drafts, research, brainstorming. AI assists but human decides: strategy, performance reviews, customer communication. AI prohibited: final legal advice, medical decisions, hiring decisions."

Question four: who is responsible for AI outputs? Covers accountability, review requirements before publishing, fact-checking expectations, quality standards. Why it matters: prevents "AI told me to" excuses, ensures quality.

## SCENE 4: The 8 Essential Components - Part 2 (2:30-4:00)
**Slide:** Components 5-8 with icons

Question five: how to use AI ethically and responsibly? Covers bias awareness, fact-checking requirements, transparency about when to disclose AI use, respect for IP and copyright. Why it matters: builds trust, avoids legal issues, maintains reputation.

Example: "Check for bias. Don't present AI output as human-created when context matters. Respect copyright. Disclose AI use when customers, partners, or stakeholders would reasonably expect to know."

Question six: what training and support is provided? Covers onboarding resources, who to ask for help, regular training updates, prompt library access. Why it matters: ensures team can use AI effectively and safely.

Example: "Complete Module One through Three training before using AI for work. Access prompt library at company-link. Questions? Ask AI-champion-name. Monthly training updates shared via Slack."

Question seven: how are violations handled? Covers warning system, escalation process, consequences for serious violations. Why it matters: creates accountability, shows policy has teeth.

Example: "First violation: warning and retraining. Repeated violations: manager review. Serious violations like sharing credentials or client data: immediate escalation to security team, potential disciplinary action."

Question eight: how often is this policy reviewed? Covers review schedule, how to suggest updates, who approves changes. Why it matters: keeps policy current as AI evolves.

Example: "Policy reviewed quarterly. Suggest updates to AI-owner-name. Changes approved by security and leadership. Major updates communicated to all staff."

## SCENE 6: Making Your Policy Stick (5:15-6:15)
**Slide:** Tips for policy adoption

How to make your policy actually get used. Tip one: make it visible. Print it. Post it. Pin it in Slack. Send reminders. Keep it top of mind.

Tip two: lead by example. If you created the policy, follow it visibly. Reference it in decisions. Show it working.

Tip three: make it easy to comply. Provide templates. Create shortcuts. Remove friction. The easier it is to follow, the more people will.

Tip four: celebrate good behavior. When someone asks "Is this allowed?" before sharing data, praise that. Reinforce the culture you want.

Tip five: update it regularly. AI changes fast. Your policy should too. Quarterly reviews. Team feedback. Continuous improvement.

Tip six: don't make it scary. Frame it as enabling fast, safe AI use. Not restricting, but protecting. Positive framing drives adoption.
