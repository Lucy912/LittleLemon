## SCENE 2: Workshop Setup (0:15-0:45)
**Slide:** "What You Need" checklist

What you need: twenty minutes of uninterrupted focus time, the Workflow Audit Template from the download link, pen or pencil or digital note-taking, and an open mind. We're auditing honestly, not ideally.

How this works: I'll explain each step for two minutes. You'll pause the video and complete it for five to ten minutes. I'll show my example for two minutes. We move to next step. Total: twenty minutes of your work, ten minutes of video.

By the end, you'll have a complete audit, three to five quick wins identified, week one action plan ready to execute, clear path to five to ten-plus hours of weekly savings. Let's go. Ready? Pause the video after each step and complete it before continuing.

## SCENE 3: Step 1 Instructions (0:45-1:30)
**Slide:** Task dump instructions with category prompts

Step one: task dump. Your task is to list everything you do in a typical week. Instructions: open the template to step one. Set timer for five minutes. Brain dump every task you do regularly. Use the category prompts: communication, content creation, analysis, creative and strategic, operations and admin, learning and research, people and meetings. Aim for twenty to forty tasks total. Don't overthink, just capture.

Examples to spark your memory: write customer emails, create weekly status reports, prepare meeting agendas, review sales data, draft social media posts, schedule team meetings, conduct interviews, write documentation.

## SCENE 5: Step 2 Instructions (2:30-3:15)
**Slide:** Scoring criteria table

Step two: score tasks. Your task is to score each task on three criteria using a one to five scale each. The three criteria: time spent per week where five equals more than two hours, four equals one to two hours, three equals thirty to sixty minutes, two equals fifteen to thirty minutes, one equals less than fifteen minutes. AI suitability where five equals eighty to one hundred percent AI can do, four equals fifty to eighty percent, three equals twenty-five to fifty percent, two equals ten to twenty-five percent, one equals less than ten percent. Repetitiveness where five equals daily, four equals three to five times per week, three equals weekly, two equals two to three times per month, one equals monthly.

Instructions: go through each task on your list, score time, AI, and repetitiveness, calculate total which is the sum of three scores, estimate time AI could save. This takes ten minutes. Go through systematically. Pause the video now. Complete step two. Come back when done.

## SCENE 6: Step 2 Example (3:15-5:00)
**Slide:** Scoring table with top 10 tasks

Welcome back! Here's how I scored my top ten tasks. Task one: respond to customer inquiries. Time four, AI five, reps five, total fourteen, saves sixty minutes per week. Task two: write weekly blog posts. Time five, AI four, reps three, total twelve, saves ninety minutes per week. Task three: create social media content. Time four, AI five, reps five, total fourteen, saves fifty minutes per week.

Let me explain a few. Task one, customer inquiry emails, scored fourteen out of fifteen. Time is four because it's one to two hours per week for about thirty emails. AI is five because AI can draft ninety percent and I personalize ten percent. Reps is five because it's every single day. Why high AI suitability? Email responses follow patterns and AI excels at this.

Task two, blog posts, scored twelve out of fifteen. Time is five, that's two to three hours per week. AI is four because AI drafts sixty percent but I edit heavily for voice. Reps is three for weekly task. Why not five on AI? Brand voice requires my touch, but AI accelerates research and structure.

Check your scoring. Are your highest scores on repetitive, time-consuming tasks? Did you score high-judgment work lower on AI? Do your top five scores feel right? Ready for step three?

## SCENE 7: Step 3 Instructions (5:00-5:30)
**Slide:** Priority tier pyramid

Step three: prioritize by impact. Your task is to sort tasks by total score and create priority tiers. Tier one: quick wins, total score twelve to fifteen. Start here. Tier two: high value, total score nine to eleven. Do these next. Tier three: worth exploring, total score six to eight. Maybe later. Tier four: low priority, total score less than six. Skip for now.

Instructions: sort your task list by total score from highest to lowest. Circle your tier one tasks with scores twelve to fifteen. These are your quick wins. Aim for three to five quick wins. Pause the video now. Complete step three. Come back when done.

## SCENE 8: Step 3 Example & Step 4 (5:30-7:00)
**Slide:** Quick wins highlighted with action criteria

Welcome back! My tier one quick wins with scores twelve to fifteen: customer inquiry emails at fourteen, social media content at fourteen, blog posts at twelve, meeting notes and follow-ups at twelve. My tier two high-value tasks with scores nine to eleven: competitor research at eleven, campaign performance review at eleven, customer feedback analysis at ten, case studies at ten.

Step four: identify true quick wins. Not all tier one tasks are week one targets. Quick win criteria: high total score, check. You already know how to use AI for this using prompts from Module Two, important. Low risk, not client-facing yet. Can implement in less than one hour of setup.

From my tier one, my true quick wins for week one: customer emails, yes, I have the email prompt from Module Two. Social media content, yes, I have the content prompt. Meeting notes, yes, I have the meeting summary prompt. Blog posts, maybe week two because they need brand voice refinement.

Your turn: from your tier one, which three can you start this week with prompts you already have? Mark those. These are your week one targets.

## SCENE 9: Step 5 - Action Plan (7:00-9:00)
**Slide:** 90-day action plan timeline

Step five: create your action plan. Week one, starting tomorrow: implement three quick wins, use existing prompts from Module Two, track time savings daily with before and after measurements, build the AI habit by using it consistently. Week one success: used AI for target tasks eighty percent-plus of the time, time saved three to five hours per week measured, quality maintained or improved, comfort level increased.

Week two: continue all quick wins, refine prompts based on results and what's working, expand to quick wins four to five if you're ready, document what's working in your notes.

Weeks three to six: implement five to eight tier two high-value tasks, develop custom prompts not just templates, apply advanced techniques like chain-of-thought and few-shot and iteration, handle more nuanced work, measure cumulative savings weekly.

Weeks seven to twelve: optimize all workflows, refine every prompt for quality, share knowledge with your team, become the AI champion, plan next quarter's opportunities.

Your action plan for tomorrow: write down your three week-one quick wins, find the matching prompts from Module Two, set a reminder to use them tomorrow, track your time on the first task before and after using AI, commit to trying all three this week.

Pause now. Write your week one plan. Three tasks, three prompts, commitment to track. Be specific. Come back when done.

## SCENE 10: Workshop Complete (9:00-10:00)
**Slide:** Completion celebration + download reminder

Welcome back! Congratulations, you just completed your workflow audit. Let's review what you have. A complete list of twenty-plus tasks you do regularly. Every task scored on time, AI suitability, and repetitiveness. Tasks prioritized into four tiers. Three to five quick wins identified for week one. A ninety-day action plan with clear next steps.

What's the value? You just identified five to ten-plus hours of weekly time savings. At fifty dollars per hour, that's two hundred fifty to five hundred dollars per week in value. Two thousand six hundred dollars per year minimum. From a twenty-minute audit. That's return on investment.

Download your completed audit template. Save it. Review it monthly. Update as you implement and find new opportunities.

Next video: ninety-day roadmap. We'll take your audit and build a detailed quarter-by-quarter implementation plan with milestones and success metrics.

Your homework: implement week one quick wins starting tomorrow. Track your actual time savings. Come back and tell me your results. Comment: which quick win are you starting with tomorrow?

Thanks for doing this work. This is where AI transformation becomes real. See you in the next video.
