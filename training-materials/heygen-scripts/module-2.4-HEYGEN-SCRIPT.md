Format: hook, story or insight, key takeaway, question to prompt comments. Tone: conversational but professional, human not corporate."

Email marketing campaign. "Act as an email marketing specialist. Task: write a five-email nurture sequence. Context: goal, main objection, key differentiator. Format: for each email, subject line, preview text, body, CTA, then explain the sequence strategy. Tone: helpful not salesy, addressing objections, building trust through value."

## SCENE 6: Customization & Module Complete (4:30-6:00)
**Slide:** Customization tips and Module 2 completion celebration

How to customize these prompts for your needs. One: adjust the context section. This is where you add your company specifics, industry nuances, constraints. Two: modify the format to match your workflow. If you need a spreadsheet instead of a table in text, specify that. Three: fine-tune the tone to match your brand voice. If you're more casual or more formal, change those descriptors. Four: combine prompts. Take the email template plus the few-shot technique. Take the analysis prompt plus chain-of-thought. Stack what you learned.

Five: save your best variations. When you customize a prompt and it works great, save that version. Build your personal library. Six: share with your team. When everyone uses the same high-quality prompts, quality goes up across the board.

Congratulations! You just completed Module Two. Let's recap what you learned. Video one: the five-part framework. Role, task, context, format, tone. Video two: wrote your first ten prompts. Hands-on practice. Video three: advanced techniques. Chain-of-thought, few-shot, iterative refinement. Video four, today: fifty-plus industry prompts ready to use.
