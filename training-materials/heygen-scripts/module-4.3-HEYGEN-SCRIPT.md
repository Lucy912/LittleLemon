## HeyGen Production Script

**Video Length:** 6 minutes
**Word Count:** ~900 words
**Format:** Word-for-word spoken script - FINAL VIDEO!
**Scene Structure:** 6 scenes covering 90-day implementation

## SCENE 1: Hook (0:00-0:15)
**Slide:** Audit transforming into calendar roadmap with milestones

You have your audit. Now let's turn it into a ninety-day roadmap that takes you from AI beginner to power user with measurable wins every two weeks. Let's build your plan.

## SCENE 2: Why You Need a Roadmap (0:15-1:00)
**Slide:** With vs Without Roadmap comparison

The problem without a plan: audit sits in drawer, never executed. Enthusiasm fades after week one. No accountability or measurement. Random AI usage instead of systematic improvement.

What a roadmap gives you: clear milestones every two weeks, accountability checkpoints, measurement framework to prove ROI, sustainable pace not burnout sprint, strategic progression from simple to advanced.

The ninety-day framework: Phase one, weeks one to two, quick wins plus habit formation. Phase two, weeks three to six, high-value tasks plus skill building. Phase three, weeks seven to twelve, optimization plus expansion. Result: eight to ten hours per week saved, AI mastery achieved. This video gives you the roadmap template. You'll complete it in ten minutes after watching.

## SCENE 3: Phase 1 - Quick Wins (1:00-2:15)
**Slide:** Phase 1 timeline with Week 1-2 breakdown

Phase one: quick wins, weeks one to two. Goal is to build momentum with immediate wins. What to do: implement three to five tier one quick wins from your audit, use prompts from Module Two don't create new ones yet, track time savings daily, build AI habits by using consistently.

Week one focus: day one, start quick wins one through three. Day two to three, apply to real work and note challenges. Day four, adjust prompts if needed for quality issues. Day five, measure time saved versus baseline.

Week two focus: continue all quick wins, refine prompts based on results, expand to quick wins four to five if ready, document what's working.

Success metrics for week two: used AI for target tasks eighty percent-plus of the time, time saved three to five hours per week measured, quality maintained or improved, comfort level increased.

Common week one to two challenges: prompts don't work perfectly first try, iterate using refinement techniques. Takes longer than expected initially, that's learning curve, speed comes week two. Forgot to use AI for task, set reminders and build triggers. Quality wasn't quite right, adjust prompts and add more context.

Checkpoint end of week two: stop and evaluate. What's the actual time saved? Track honestly. Which quick wins delivered most value? What prompts need refinement? Am I ready for phase two? Don't move to phase two until quick wins are consistent.

## SCENE 4: Phase 2 - High-Value Tasks (2:15-3:45)
**Slide:** Phase 2 timeline with Week 3-6 breakdown

Phase two: high-value tasks, weeks three to six. Goal is to expand to more complex, higher-impact opportunities. What to do: implement five to eight tier two high-value tasks, develop custom prompts not just Module Two templates, apply advanced techniques like chain-of-thought, few-shot, and iteration, handle more nuanced work.

Week three to four focus is expansion. Week three, add two to three tier two tasks, choose tasks you do weekly for regular practice, may require custom prompt development, test and refine over the week. Week four, add two to three more tier two tasks, focus on analysis or strategic work, apply chain-of-thought for complex tasks, use few-shot for style-sensitive work.

Week five to six focus is refinement. Week five, optimize all workflows, refine prompts based on two weeks of use, chain multiple AI tasks together, build templates for recurring work. Week six, consolidate gains, document your best prompts, create personal prompt library, share wins with team or manager.

Success metrics for week six: total time saved six to eight hours per week cumulative, using AI for ten to twelve different task types, prompts refined and reliable, confidence in advanced techniques.

Common week three to six challenges: complex tasks need more prompt work, use chain-of-thought and break into steps. Quality varies batch to batch, add more context and specify format better. Too many tasks at once, scale back and consolidate before adding more. Team questions your AI use, share results data and offer to help them.

Checkpoint end of week six: major evaluation. Total time saved since start in hours per week. Most valuable AI application. Biggest surprise. What's working well. What needs more work. Ready for phase three. You should now be saving six to eight-plus hours per week. If not, spend another two weeks optimizing before phase three.

## SCENE 5: Phase 3 - Mastery & Expansion (3:45-5:00)
**Slide:** Phase 3 timeline with Week 7-12 breakdown

Phase three: optimization and expansion, weeks seven to twelve. Goal is to master AI workflows and become a power user. What to do: optimize existing workflows making good into great, explore advanced applications, share knowledge with team, plan next quarter.

Week seven to eight, deep optimization: review all AI workflows in use, iterate each prompt for better results using iteration technique, measure quality not just speed, identify and fix any weak points, consider are there tasks I should stop AI-optimizing because ROI is too low.

Week nine to ten, strategic expansion: explore tier three opportunities if capacity, test new AI capabilities because models improve monthly, chain workflows together where output of one AI task becomes input to next, build advanced automations if applicable, consider what could I do with ten hours per week saved.

Week eleven to twelve, knowledge sharing and planning: document your best practices, create internal guide for team, run AI training session for colleagues, identify opportunities for team-wide adoption, plan next quarter's AI initiatives.

Success metrics for week twelve: total time saved eight to ten-plus hours per week cumulative, AI workflows are reliable and high-quality, shared knowledge with at least three team members, have clear plan for next quarter.

Final checkpoint end of week twelve, complete review: time saved in hours per week total, tasks AI-optimized count, quality level maintained or improved or mixed, team impact, ROI calculation twenty-minute audit leads to how many hours per year saved equals what return, biggest win of the quarter.

## SCENE 6: Complete Your Roadmap & Course Complete! (5:00-6:00)
**Slide:** Course completion celebration + roadmap template + final CTA

Congratulations! You just completed the entire AI training course. All four modules. Let's celebrate what you learned.

Module One: AI fundamentals. You learned what AI can do, which tools to use, and got your first three wins. Module Two: prompt engineering. You mastered the five-part framework, wrote ten prompts, learned advanced techniques, and got fifty-plus industry templates. Module Three: ethics and security. You learned what not to put in AI, how to verify outputs, and how to build an AI policy. Module Four, today: workflow optimization. You audited your work, identified opportunities, and built your ninety-day roadmap.

You're now in the top one percent of AI users. You have frameworks. You have prompts. You have a plan. You have the skills to save eight to ten-plus hours every single week.

Download your Ninety-Day Roadmap Template. Fill in your three phases with specific tasks and dates. Put milestones in your calendar. Start tomorrow. Not next week. Tomorrow.

Your challenge: execute week one. Report back your time savings. Help someone else learn AI. Become the AI champion in your world.

Thank you for completing this training. You invested the time. Now go get the results. I can't wait to hear about your wins. Leave a final comment: what's your week one goal?

Thanks for watching. Now go save some time.
