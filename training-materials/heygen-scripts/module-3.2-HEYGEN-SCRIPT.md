## SCENE 1: Hook (0:00-0:15)
**Slide:** AI confidently presenting false information

AI will confidently lie to you. It will make up facts, cite non-existent sources, and reinforce your biases. Here's how to catch it before it embarrasses you. This is critical.

## SCENE 2: Why AI Gets Things Wrong (0:15-1:00)
**Slide:** "How AI Actually Works" diagram

Reality check. AI doesn't "know" things. It predicts likely word sequences. There's no fact database, no truth detector. "Sounds right" does not equal "is right."

AI hallucinates, which means it makes things up. It invents sources that don't exist. It creates plausible-sounding fake data. It fabricates quotes, studies, statistics. Confidence level does not equal accuracy.

AI has biases from training data. It reflects biases in internet text, which skews Western, English, male perspectives. It has outdated information because of knowledge cutoff dates. It overrepresents certain viewpoints and misses diverse perspectives.

The problem? AI output sounds so confident and professional that we trust it without verifying. Real incidents: lawyers citing fake court cases got sanctioned. Journalists using fabricated quotes had reputations destroyed. Businesses basing decisions on hallucinated data made costly mistakes. This video teaches you to trust but verify.

## SCENE 3: The 5 Types of AI Errors (1:00-3:00)
**Slide:** 5 error types with icons and examples

Error type one: hallucination, pure fiction. AI invents information that doesn't exist. Examples: citing research papers never published, creating fake statistics, inventing product features, making up historical events. Red flags: very specific citations without URLs, statistics without sources, "according to a study" without saying which study, perfect answer to obscure question. How to catch it: ask for sources, Google the claims, verify citations actually exist.

Error type two: outdated information. AI's training data has a cutoff date, often one to two years ago. Examples: current events it doesn't know about, new laws or regulations or standards, recent research findings, company acquisitions or leadership changes, technology updates. Red flags: information about "current" events, statements like "as of 2023" when it's 2025, missing recent developments. How to catch it: check dates, verify with recent sources, use web search for current info.

Error type three: cultural and demographic bias. AI reflects biases from its training data. Examples: defaulting to Western perspectives, assuming English-language contexts, gender stereotypes in career suggestions, geographic bias overrepresenting the US, socioeconomic assumptions. Red flags: generic advice that doesn't fit your context, assumptions about your audience or market, one-size-fits-all recommendations. How to catch it: question assumptions, specify your context, seek diverse perspectives.

Error type four: logical inconsistencies. AI contradicts itself or makes illogical leaps. Examples: contradicting statements in same response, faulty reasoning in step-by-step analysis, mixing up cause and effect, cherry-picking data to fit conclusion. Red flags: conclusion doesn't follow from premises, different parts of response conflict, oversimplified complex issues. How to catch it: read critically, check logic, ask AI to explain reasoning.

Error type five: overconfidence on uncertainty. AI presents uncertain information as fact. Examples: predictions stated as certainties, "this will definitely" when nothing is definite, ignoring nuance and complexity, single "right answer" to complex question. Red flags: absolute language like "always," "never," "definitely," no caveats or limitations mentioned, oversimplified answers to complex questions. How to catch it: ask for limitations, alternative viewpoints, and sources of uncertainty.

## SCENE 4: The 4-Step Verification Method (3:00-5:00)
**Slide:** 4-step verification flowchart

When should you verify AI outputs? Always verify when: facts will be shared publicly in posts, articles, or presentations. Decisions have significant consequences for business strategy, legal matters, or financial decisions. Information seems too convenient or perfect. You're in a regulated industry like healthcare, finance, or legal. Data includes numbers, statistics, or research citations.

You can skip verification when: brainstorming ideas that aren't final outputs. Creative writing like fiction or marketing concepts. Personal use with no external impact. You have direct expertise to judge accuracy immediately.

Here's the four-step verification method. Step one: source check. Ask AI for sources. "Where did this information come from? Provide sources." Then verify those sources. Do the sources actually exist? Google them. Do they actually say what AI claims? Read them. Are sources credible? Check author credentials and publication reputation. Are sources recent? Check publication dates.

Example: AI says "Studies show eighty-five percent of companies use AI." You ask "What studies? Provide specific sources." AI says "According to McKinsey's 2023 AI report." You Google "McKinsey 2023 AI report" to verify it exists and contains that stat.

Step two: cross-reference check. Don't trust a single source, including AI. Search the claim on Google. Check two to three independent authoritative sources. Look for consensus versus outlier claims. Check official sources like company websites, government sites, academic institutions.

Step three: logic check. Does the reasoning make sense? Are there logical fallacies? Does the conclusion follow from the evidence? Are there obvious contradictions? If you spot logical problems, the data might be wrong too.

Step four: bias check. What perspective is missing? Would someone from a different background see this differently? Are there unstated assumptions? Is there nuance being ignored? Ask AI: "What are the limitations of this analysis? What alternative viewpoints exist?"

## SCENE 5: Quick Verification Prompts (5:00-5:45)
**Slide:** Template prompts for verification

Use these prompts to verify AI outputs. "Provide specific sources for the claims you just made, including URLs." "What are the limitations and potential biases in this analysis?" "What evidence would contradict this conclusion?" "Explain your reasoning step-by-step for this recommendation." "What alternative perspectives or viewpoints exist on this topic?" "How recent is the data you're basing this on? What has changed since then?"

These prompts force AI to reveal its reasoning, acknowledge uncertainty, and surface potential problems. Copy them. Save them. Use them every time you verify.

## SCENE 6: When to Trust AI (5:45-6:30)
**Slide:** Trust matrix showing risk vs verification

Not everything needs verification. Here's when you can trust AI more readily. Brainstorming and ideation, no external consequences. Learning and education, you're the only audience. Creative writing, it's fiction or draft. Reformatting or restructuring, you control the content. Tasks where you have expertise to immediately spot errors.

Here's when you must verify. Public communication, your reputation is on the line. Business decisions, money or strategy involved. Regulated work, compliance required. Data-driven arguments, numbers must be right. Anything involving legal, medical, financial advice.

The rule: the higher the stakes, the more verification required. Use your judgment.

## SCENE 7: Recap & Download (6:30-7:00)
**Slide:** Verification checklist and key takeaways

Let's recap. AI makes five types of errors: hallucination or pure fiction, outdated information, cultural and demographic bias, logical inconsistencies, overconfidence on uncertainty. Use the four-step verification method: source check, cross-reference check, logic check, bias check. Use verification prompts to force AI to reveal reasoning and limitations.

Download the AI Verification Checklist. One page with all five error types, the four-step method, and verification prompts. Keep it visible when working with AI.

Next video: building your AI policy in thirty minutes. Creating practical guidelines for yourself or your team. Comment: have you ever caught AI making something up? What was it?

Thanks for watching. Verify before you trust. See you in the next video.
