## SCENE 1: Hook (0:00-0:15)
**Slide:** Grid of 10,000 AI tool logos fading to just 3

There are over ten thousand AI tools out there right now. New ones launching every single day. But here's the truth: you need exactly three to start. I'm going to show you which ones and why in the next seven minutes.

## SCENE 2: Promise (0:15-0:45)
**Slide:** "What You'll Learn" with 3 bullets

Here's what we're covering today. First, the three-tool AI starter stack, and yes, all of them have free versions. Second, ChatGPT versus Claude versus Gemini. When should you use each one? And third, when to upgrade from free to paid, and more importantly, when not to upgrade.

And here's what you don't need. You don't need fifty different AI subscriptions. You don't need specialized tools yet. And you definitely don't need expensive enterprise licenses when you're just starting out. Keep it simple.

## SCENE 3: Your 3-Tool Starter Stack (0:45-2:15)
**Slide:** Three tool logos with key features listed

Let me give you your starter stack. These are the three tools you need.

Tool number one: ChatGPT from OpenAI. This is your general-purpose tool. Use it for writing, brainstorming, quick answers, basically your everyday AI tasks. The free version runs on GPT-3.5, which is surprisingly good for most things you'll do. The paid version at twenty dollars per month gets you GPT-4, which has better reasoning and makes fewer mistakes. You'll use ChatGPT for probably eighty percent of your AI needs.

Tool number two: Claude from Anthropic. This one's for when you need more depth. Use Claude for long documents, complex analysis, coding help, and nuanced tasks. The free version gives you Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which is excellent and very capable. The paid version at twenty dollars per month gives you higher usage limits and access to Claude 3 Opus. When ChatGPT gives you shallow answers, switch to Claude.

Tool number three: Perplexity or Google Gemini. Use these for research with citations, current information, and fact-checking. Both have free versions that work great. Use them when you need sources, when you need recent information from 2024 or 2025, or when you want to verify what other AI tools told you.

Here's the key point. Start with all free versions. Only upgrade when you actually hit the limits and need more.

## SCENE 4: Decision Tree - Which Tool When? (2:15-3:45)
**Slide:** Decision tree flowchart

So how do you decide which tool to use? Let me make this really simple.

Use ChatGPT when you need quick everyday tasks. Writing emails, creating social media posts, explaining concepts simply, brainstorming ideas. ChatGPT is your default AI tool. When you're not sure which one to use, start with ChatGPT.

Use Claude when you're analyzing long documents, like a hundred pages or more. When you need complex reasoning or nuanced responses. When you're doing code review or need programming help. And especially when ChatGPT's answer feels shallow or not quite right.

Use Perplexity or Gemini when you're researching current events, anything from 2024 onward. When you need citations and sources for your work. When you're fact-checking information from other AI tools. And when you're doing academic or research work where sources matter.

Here's a quick example. Let's say you want to write a blog post about AI. With ChatGPT, you'll get a quick draft that's creative and ready to go. With Claude, you'll get something more thoughtful and carefully structured. With Perplexity, you'll get a post backed by research citations and sources.

They each have their strength. You just need to match the tool to the task.

## SCENE 5: Free vs Paid - When to Upgrade (3:45-5:00)
**Slide:** ROI calculator showing $20 investment vs time saved

Let's talk about when you should stay free and when you should upgrade to paid.

Stay with the free versions if you're using AI less than an hour per day. If the free versions are meeting your needs, why pay? If you're still learning and experimenting, stick with free. And obviously, if budget is tight, free is perfectly fine.

Upgrade to paid, which is about twenty dollars per month, when you start hitting usage limits on the free versions. When AI is saving you two or more hours every day. When you need GPT-4's better reasoning for professional work. And when the quality of free versions isn't good enough for client work or important projects.

Here's my recommendation for timing. Month one, use all free versions. Get comfortable with them. Month two, if you're using AI every single day, upgrade one tool. Usually that's ChatGPT. Month three, add a second paid tool if you really need it. That's usually Claude.

Let me give you the ROI calculation because this matters. If you earn fifty dollars per hour and AI saves you two hours per week, that's a hundred dollars per week in value. The cost is twenty dollars per month. You break even in week one. The rest of the month is pure profit.

## SCENE 6: Tools You Don't Need Yet (5:00-6:15)
**Slide:** List of tools to skip with costs shown

Now let me save you some money. Here are the tools you don't need yet.

Skip specialized AI writers like Jasper, Copy.ai, and Writesonic. Why? ChatGPT and Claude do the same thing. You'll save fifty to a hundred dollars per month.

Skip AI image generators like Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion unless image creation is your core business need. Start with free alternatives like Bing Image Creator first.

Skip AI video tools like Synthesia and Runway. They're expensive and they're for niche use cases. Wait until you have a specific video production need.

Skip AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot unless you're coding every single day. For occasional coding needs, Claude or ChatGPT work fine.

Skip AI meeting assistants like Otter and Fireflies. ChatGPT can summarize transcripts just fine. Upgrade to these later when you're in meetings all day.

And definitely skip enterprise AI solutions. Those cost ten thousand dollars or more per year. They're complete overkill until you have fifty or more employees using AI.

See the pattern here? Start simple. Add complexity only when the free and basic tools start limiting you. Don't pay for features you're not using yet.

## SCENE 7: Recap & Call to Action (6:15-7:00)
**Slide:** Summary with 3 tools + download link

Let me recap your three-tool starter stack. ChatGPT for general use and eighty percent of your tasks. Claude for complex work and long documents. Perplexity or Gemini for research and citations.

All three have free versions. Start there. Upgrade when you hit usage limits, when AI is saving you two or more hours per day, or when quality really matters for paid work.

I've created a decision tree for you that you can download. It's a flowchart that shows you which AI tool to use for which task. It includes upgrade timing guidance and a list of free alternatives to expensive tools. The link is in the description below.

In the next video, I'm going to show you your first three AI wins. You're going to save time today, not next week.

Leave a comment and tell me: which tool are you trying first? ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity?

Thanks for watching. I'll see you in the next one.
