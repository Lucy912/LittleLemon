## SCENE 2: Why Audit Your Workflow (0:15-1:00)
**Slide:** Problem vs Solution comparison

The problem most people face: you learned AI tools and prompts, check. But you don't know where to apply them. Result? Random AI usage, inconsistent value.

What an audit gives you: clear list of high-impact opportunities, prioritized by time savings times frequency times ease. Focus on the twenty percent of tasks that create eighty percent of value. Personalized roadmap for your work, not generic advice.

Time investment: twenty-minute audit today. Identifies five to ten-plus hours of weekly savings. ROI: fifteen to thirty times within first month. This video teaches the audit method. Next video, we'll do it together as a workshop.

## SCENE 3: The 5-Step Audit Method (1:00-2:00)
**Slide:** 5-step flowchart with time estimates

Here's the five-step audit method. Step one: capture your tasks. What you actually do. Step two: score AI potential. Which tasks AI can help with. Step three: prioritize by impact. Biggest wins first. Step four: identify quick wins. Start here. Step five: create action plan. What to do when.

Total time: twenty minutes if you follow the template. Output: prioritized list of eight to twelve AI opportunities plus ninety-day implementation plan. Let me break down each step.

## SCENE 4: Step 1 - Capture Your Tasks (2:00-3:15)
**Slide:** Task categories with example lists

Step one: capture your tasks. Goal is to list everything you do in a typical week. The method is a task dump, a brain dump of work activities.

Instructions: set timer for five minutes. List every task type you do regularly. Don't filter or judge, just capture. Include daily recurring tasks, weekly and monthly tasks, project work, admin and overhead, and communication.

Categories to prompt your thinking: communication like emails, Slack, meetings, phone calls. Content creation like writing, presentations, reports, social posts. Analysis like data review, research, competitive analysis, reporting. Creative work like design, brainstorming, strategy, planning. Operations like scheduling, filing, data entry, process tasks. Learning like research, reading, skill development. People work like one-on-ones, reviews, hiring, team coordination.

Example task list: write customer emails, create weekly status reports, prepare meeting agendas, review and analyze sales data, draft social media posts, schedule team meetings, conduct job interviews, write product documentation, research competitors, prepare client presentations, review team work or code, fill out expense reports, create training materials, and continue for twenty to forty tasks.

Pro tip: track one actual day in detail if you can't remember everything. Time for Step One: five minutes and you now have twenty to forty tasks listed.

## SCENE 5: Step 2 - Score AI Potential (3:15-5:00)
**Slide:** Scoring matrix with examples

Step two: score AI potential. Goal is to determine which tasks AI can actually help with. Three scoring criteria on a one to five scale for each.

Criteria one: time spent. Five equals takes more than two hours per week. Four equals one to two hours per week. Three equals thirty minutes to one hour per week. Two equals fifteen to thirty minutes per week. One equals less than fifteen minutes per week.

Criteria two: AI suitability. Five equals AI can do eighty to one hundred percent of this task. Four equals fifty to eighty percent. Three equals twenty-five to fifty percent. Two equals ten to twenty-five percent. One equals AI can barely help, less than ten percent.

Criteria three: repetitiveness. Five equals do this daily. Four equals three to five times per week. Three equals weekly. Two equals two to three times per month. One equals monthly or less.

How to assess AI suitability: High AI suitability, four to five points, includes writing first drafts, summarizing content, data analysis and pattern finding, brainstorming and ideation, research and information gathering, formatting and restructuring content, creating templates and frameworks. Medium AI suitability, two to three points, includes strategic planning where AI assists and you decide, quality review where AI suggests and you judge, creative work requiring brand voice, complex problem-solving, relationship-building communication. Low AI suitability, one point, includes high-stakes final decisions, emotional or sensitive conversations, tasks requiring deep domain expertise, physical work, real-time interactive work like live presentations or negotiations.

Scoring example: task is "write customer emails, responses to inquiries." Time spent: four, that's one to two hours per week for twenty to thirty emails. AI suitability: five, AI can draft ninety percent and I edit and personalize. Repetitiveness: five, daily task. Total score: fourteen out of fifteen. High priority for AI optimization.

Go through your entire task list and score each one. Time for step two: ten minutes and all tasks are now scored.

## SCENE 6: Step 3 - Prioritize by Impact (5:00-6:00)
**Slide:** Priority tiers visualization

Step three: prioritize by impact. Goal is to identify the highest-value opportunities. Create priority tiers.

Tier one: quick wins with total score twelve to fifteen. High scores across all criteria. Start here for immediate ROI. Typically three to five tasks.

Tier two: high value with total score nine to eleven. Good opportunities, slightly more effort. Implement after quick wins. Typically five to eight tasks.

Tier three: worth exploring with total score six to eight. Marginal benefit or requires more work. Consider after tier one and two complete. May not be worth the effort.

Tier four: low priority with total score less than six. Skip these for now. Not enough benefit to justify time investment. Revisit in six months if other opportunities are exhausted.

Sort your tasks by total score. Identify your tier one quick wins, your top three to five tasks. Time for step three: three minutes and tasks are now prioritized.

## SCENE 7: Steps 4 & 5 - Quick Wins & Action Plan (6:00-7:30)
**Slide:** Quick win criteria and action plan template

Step four: identify quick wins. Goal is to find the easiest high-impact opportunities to start with. Quick win criteria: high total score of twelve to fifteen, you already know how to use AI for this using prompts from Module Two, low risk meaning not client-facing or high-stakes, can implement in less than one hour.

Your tier one quick wins from step three should have two to three that meet all four criteria. These are your Week One targets. Time for step four: two minutes.

Step five: create action plan. Goal is to turn audit into execution roadmap. Week one: implement three quick wins, use existing prompts from Module Two, track time savings daily. Week two: refine based on results, add more quick wins if ready, measure actual savings. Weeks three to six: expand to tier two tasks, develop custom prompts, apply advanced techniques. Weeks seven to twelve: optimize all workflows, share with team, plan next quarter.

Time for step five: five minutes and you have a complete ninety-day roadmap. We'll build this in detail in Video Four-Three.
