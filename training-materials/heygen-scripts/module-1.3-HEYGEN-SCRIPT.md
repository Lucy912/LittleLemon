## SCENE 1: Hook (0:00-0:15)
**Slide:** Timer showing "90 minutes saved TODAY"

## SCENE 2: Promise (0:15-0:45)

Here are your three wins. Win one: respond to five emails in ten minutes and save thirty minutes per day. Win two: turn meeting notes into action items in three minutes and save twenty minutes per meeting. Win three: draft content in five minutes and save forty-five minutes per piece.

Total time saved from these three simple tasks? Ninety minutes. And you'll get a step-by-step guide so you can do all three today. Not next week. Today.

## SCENE 3: Win 1 - Email Responses (1:00-2:30)
**Slide:** Email template with before/after comparison

Let's start with win one: email responses. Here's the problem. You have ten or more emails needing responses. Each takes five to ten minutes to write thoughtfully. That's thirty to sixty minutes total just on email every single day.

Here's the AI solution in three steps. Step one: copy the email you received. Step two: use this prompt. Act as a professional who values clear, friendly communication. Task: write a response to this email. Context: paste the email here, then add your situation. For example, I'm interested but need to check budget, or declining politely because I'm too busy. Format: professional email, two to three paragraphs, warm tone. Tone: friendly but direct, helpful.

Step three: review the response, personalize one or two sentences, and send. The AI writes ninety percent. You add ten percent personal touch. Time per email? Two minutes. It used to take five to ten minutes.

Let me show you a real example. I received a meeting invitation I need to decline. I paste the email into the template. I add my context: declining politely, schedule is full this month, want to leave door open for next month. ChatGPT generates a perfect response. I personalize the opening line, and send. Total time? Ninety seconds.

Your turn. Open your inbox right now. Pick three emails needing responses. Use this template. Send them within ten minutes. Time saved: thirty minutes per day, times five days per week. That's two and a half hours every week just from emails.

## SCENE 4: Win 2 - Meeting Notes to Action Items (2:30-4:00)
**Slide:** Meeting notes before/after with action items table

Win two: turning meeting notes into action items. Here's the problem. A one-hour meeting generates messy notes. You need to create a clean summary with action items. This takes twenty to thirty minutes after every meeting, and it's often delayed or completely skipped because nobody wants to spend thirty minutes on this.

Here's the AI solution. Step one: during the meeting, take rough notes. They can be messy. Bullet points, fragments, whatever you capture. Or record the meeting and transcribe it.

Step two: immediately after the meeting, use this prompt. Act as an executive assistant who creates actionable meeting summaries. Task: turn these meeting notes into a clean summary with action items. Context: meeting about your topic, attendees with names. Notes: paste your rough notes here. Format: summary in two to three sentences, key decisions as a bullet list, action items in a table with three columns for task, owner, and deadline, and open questions. Tone: clear and actionable.

Step three: copy the result and send it to your team. The AI does the structure and clarity. You verify accuracy. Time: three minutes. It used to take twenty to thirty minutes.

Let me show you an example. Here are my messy meeting notes: talked about Q4 goals, John handling marketing, Sarah on sales, need budget approval by next week, question about timeline. I paste this into the template, and AI generates a clean summary with a formatted action items table. John gets marketing tasks, Sarah gets sales tasks, budget deadline is clear.

Your turn. After your next meeting today, use this template. Send the summary within five minutes. Time saved: twenty minutes per meeting, times five meetings per week. That's one point seven hours every week.

## SCENE 5: Win 3 - Content Drafts (4:00-5:30)
**Slide:** Content template with LinkedIn post example

Win three: content drafts. Here's the problem. You need to write a LinkedIn post, email newsletter, blog intro, or social media update. You're staring at a blank page for thirty to forty-five minutes. And your first draft usually needs heavy editing anyway.

Here's the AI solution. Step one: know your goal and key points. Step two: use this prompt. Act as your role or voice. For example, a marketing professional or thought leader. Task: write a specific type of content like a LinkedIn post or email. Context: your topic, main points to cover with two to three bullet points, your audience, and your goal like inform or inspire. Format: be very specific. For LinkedIn, hook in the first line, three short paragraphs, end with a question. Tone: your brand voice like conversational, professional, or witty.

Step three: edit for your voice and post. The AI provides structure and flow. You add personal stories and examples. Time: ten minutes. It used to take forty-five to sixty minutes.

Let me show you a real example. I need to write a LinkedIn post about why most people use AI wrong. I tell the AI to act as a thought leader with a conversational, slightly provocative style. My topic is AI mistakes. My key points are: people obsess over tools, lack prompting skills, and don't integrate AI into workflows. Format: hook, three paragraphs, question at the end. Tone: confident but not arrogant. ChatGPT generates a strong draft. I add one personal story from my experience, and it's ready to post. Total time: eight minutes.

Your turn. Write one piece of content you've been putting off. Use this template. Publish it today. Time saved: forty-five minutes per piece, times three pieces per week. That's two point two five hours every week.

## SCENE 6: Recap & Challenge (5:30-6:45)
**Slide:** Summary card showing all 3 wins with checkmarks

Let me recap your three wins today. Win one: emails. You have the email response prompt template. Time: two minutes per email. You save thirty minutes per day. Win two: meeting notes. You have the meeting summary prompt template. Time: three minutes per meeting. You save twenty minutes per meeting. Win three: content. You have the content draft prompt template. Time: ten minutes per piece. You save forty-five minutes per piece.

Total weekly time saved? Emails save two and a half hours. Meetings save one point seven hours. Content saves two point two five hours. Total: six and a half hours per week. That's almost a full workday back in your calendar.

Here's your challenge. Do all three wins today. Not tomorrow. Today. One: respond to three emails in ten minutes. Two: after your next meeting, create a summary in three minutes. Three: draft one piece of content in ten minutes.

Download the Quick Wins Guide. It has all three prompt templates, step-by-step checklists, and more examples for each win.
