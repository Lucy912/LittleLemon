## SCENE 1: Hook (0:00-0:15)
**Slide:** Basic prompt vs advanced prompt with dramatically different outputs

You know the framework. You've written ten prompts. Now I'll show you three techniques that will make you better than ninety-nine percent of AI users. And they're easier than you think. Let's go.

## SCENE 2: Promise (0:15-0:45)
**Slide:** "3 Advanced Techniques" with icons

Here's what you're learning. Technique one: chain-of-thought prompting. Make AI show its work for better reasoning. Technique two: few-shot learning. Train AI with examples in seconds. Technique three: iterative refinement. Turn good into perfect in two iterations.

What you'll gain: ten times better quality on complex tasks. Ability to handle nuanced, sophisticated requests. Confidence to tackle problems you thought AI couldn't solve. These are techniques used by AI researchers and power users. Time to master each one? Five minutes to learn, lifetime to master.

## SCENE 3: The Problem with Basic Prompts (0:45-1:30)
**Slide:** Example showing superficial AI output

Why do basic prompts fail on complex tasks? Let me show you. Basic prompt: "Analyze this business strategy and tell me if it's good." What happens? AI gives a superficial answer. It misses nuances. There's no structured reasoning. Just generic advice.

Why does it fail? Too vague. No thinking process required. No examples of what good analysis looks like. No iteration framework. The solution? Three advanced techniques that solve each of these problems. Let's start with chain-of-thought.

## SCENE 4: Technique 1 - Chain-of-Thought (1:30-3:30)
**Slide:** Chain-of-thought diagram with step-by-step flow

Chain-of-thought prompting. What is it? Ask AI to think step-by-step before answering. The magic phrase is: "Let's think through this step by step." Why does it work? It forces logical reasoning. It catches mistakes mid-process. It shows the why behind conclusions. And it dramatically improves accuracy on complex tasks.

Let me show you before and after. Without chain-of-thought: "Should I invest fifty thousand euros in expanding to Germany?" AI says: "Yes, it's a good market with strong economy." That's generic, superficial, risky advice.

Now with chain-of-thought: "Should I invest fifty thousand euros in expanding to Germany? Let's think through this step by step. First, analyze market conditions. Then, assess competitive landscape. Then, evaluate our readiness. Finally, recommend a decision with reasoning."

Look at this output. "Step one: Market Analysis. Germany's B2B services market is growing, but... Step two: Competitive Landscape. Three major players dominate, our differentiation is... Step three: Readiness Assessment. We lack German-speaking staff, legal entity, and... Step four: Recommendation. WAIT. Instead, test with a five-thousand-euro pilot targeting..."

See the difference? It's structured. It's thorough. It's actionable. When should you use chain-of-thought? Complex decisions like investments, strategy, hiring. Multi-step analysis like data interpretation or problem-solving. Technical explanations like debugging. Creative planning like campaigns or projects. Don't use it for simple tasks like basic writing or quick questions.

Pro tip: number the steps to enforce structure. One, two, three forces AI to follow your framework.

## SCENE 5: Technique 2 - Few-Shot Learning (3:30-5:30)
**Slide:** Few-shot examples with pattern matching visual

Technique two: few-shot learning. What is it? Give AI two to three examples of what you want, then ask for more. Why does it work? It shows style, tone, and format better than description. AI pattern-matches your examples. It captures nuances that words can't describe. It's like showing a designer mockups instead of describing your vision.

Here's the formula. "Here are examples of what you want. Example one, example two, example three. Now create more like these for your specific context."

Let me show you a real example. Email style training. "I need five more customer follow-up emails in the same style as these. Example one: Subject, quick question about your onboarding. Hey Sarah, noticed you haven't logged in yet. Anything blocking you? Happy to jump on a ten-minute call to help. Mike.

Example two: Subject, how's it going? Hi Tom, checking in on your first week. Questions? Bugs? Feature requests? Reply with anything and I'll handle it. Mike.

Example three: Subject, you're quiet. Hey Lisa, you were active week one, then went silent. Did we lose you? What happened? Honest feedback helps us improve. Mike.

Now write five more follow-up emails in this same style for: user who viewed pricing but didn't buy, user whose trial expires in three days, user who canceled subscription, user who completed onboarding but hasn't used key feature, power user we want to turn into case study."

The output? Five emails that perfectly match your voice, tone, length, and approach. When should you use few-shot? Matching specific writing style or voice. Generating similar items like emails, social posts, or code. When you can show examples but can't describe the pattern. Maintaining consistency across content.

Don't use it when you only have one example. You need two to three minimum. And don't use it when examples are too diverse because it confuses the pattern. Pro tip: three examples is the sweet spot. Two is minimum, four or more rarely helps.

## SCENE 6: Technique 3 - Iterative Refinement (5:30-7:00)
**Slide:** 3-iteration progression showing improvement

Technique three: iterative refinement. What is it? Start with a good prompt, then improve the output through conversation. Why does it work? It's faster than trying to be perfect the first time. You don't need to anticipate everything. It allows course correction. It builds on what's already good.

Here's the three-iteration formula. Iteration one: generate at eighty percent quality. Start with a solid prompt using the framework. Iteration two: refine to ninety-five percent quality. Say: "This is good, but make this specific change. Keep everything else the same." Iteration three: perfect at ninety-nine percent quality. Say: "Almost perfect. Just change this tiny detail."

Let me show you a LinkedIn post refinement. Iteration one: "Act as a LinkedIn ghostwriter known for viral B2B posts. Task: write a post about how we reduced customer churn by forty percent. Context: we implemented a new onboarding flow based on user research. Main insight: we were teaching features when we should have been enabling outcomes. Format: hook, three bullet points, conclusion with question. Two hundred words. Tone: conversational but credible."

The output is good but not perfect. Iteration two: "This is good, but make the hook more provocative. Something that challenges common assumptions about onboarding. Keep the rest exactly as is."

Output improves. Iteration three: "Perfect. Just change the closing question to be more specific. Ask what their biggest onboarding challenge is, not a vague 'what do you think?'"

Now it's ready to publish. When to use iterative refinement? Always. For everything. Because perfection on try one is hard. Refinement is easy. Pro tip: be specific about what to change and what to keep. Otherwise AI might rewrite everything.

## SCENE 7: Recap & Quick Reference (7:00-7:45)
**Slide:** All 3 techniques summary card

Let's recap your three advanced techniques. Chain-of-thought: add "let's think through this step by step" to complex prompts. Use it for decisions, analysis, technical work, planning. Forces structured reasoning.

Few-shot learning: show AI two to three examples, ask for more in that style. Use it for matching voice, generating similar content, capturing patterns words can't describe. Three examples is the sweet spot.

Iterative refinement: start good, refine twice. Say what to change and what to keep. Use it for everything. Perfection through conversation, not perfect first try.

Combine these techniques. Use chain-of-thought with few-shot. Use few-shot then refine iteratively. Stack them for expert-level results.
