- AI output: Screenshot-style box with gray background
- Use red X (❌) to indicate "bad"
- Font: 28pt for prompt, 24pt for output

**Visual Assets Needed:**
- Screenshot or mockup of generic ChatGPT response
- OR create stylized text box representing AI output

**Speaker Notes:**
```
Let me show you the problem most people have with AI. They open ChatGPT and type something like "Write me a business email." And what do they get? Something generic. Something that sounds like a robot wrote it. It's not helpful, and it definitely doesn't save time.

Here's the insight that changed everything for me. The difference between thinking AI is useless and AI saving you ten hours every week comes down to one thing: how you ask. That's it. It's not about the AI. It's about how you communicate with it.

The solution is what I call the Five-Part Prompt Framework. And I'm going to show it to you right now using three real examples.

### SLIDE 4: Example 1 - Business Email (Scene 4, 2:00-3:30)
**Content:** Framework applied to email example

│  🎭 Role: Busy professional            │
│  🎯 Task: Decline meeting email        │
│  📋 Context: Vendor, budget frozen     │
│  📐 Format: 3-4 sentences              │
│  🎨 Tone: Warm but direct              │
│                                         │
│  Result: ✅ Ready to use!              │
│                                         │
│                         [AVATAR]        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Design Specs:**
- Framework parts: Color-coded (as in script: purple, blue, green, orange, pink)
- Emojis: Use the exact ones shown (🎭🎯📋📐🎨)
- Font: 28pt for framework items
- Result: Green checkmark, 36pt
- Side-by-side optional: Show bad vs good output

**Visual Enhancement:**
- Consider showing the actual email output on right side
- Before/after comparison if space allows

**Speaker Notes:**
```
Let's start with example one: writing a business email. Here's the bad way. You type "Write an email declining a meeting" and you get something generic that doesn't fit your situation at all.

Now here's the good way, using the Five-Part Framework. First, the role. Act as a busy professional who values relationships. Second, the task. Write an email declining a meeting invitation. Third, the context. The meeting is with a vendor I want to maintain good relations with. I'm declining because our budget is frozen this quarter, but I want to leave the door open for collaboration next quarter.

Fourth, the format. Professional email, three to four sentences maximum. Keep it short. And fifth, the tone. Warm but direct. Apologetic but not over-explaining.

Look at the difference. This output is human. It's specific to your exact situation. And it's ready to use immediately. You can copy, paste, maybe change one or two words, and send it.

│                         [AVATAR]        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Design Specs:**
- Same color-coding as Slide 4
- Show simplified table output example
- Table: 24pt font, clear borders
- Emphasize structured output

**Visual Enhancement:**
- Table mockup showing how AI organizes data
- Before: Messy feedback; After: Clean table

**Speaker Notes:**
```
Example two: data analysis. Let's say you have customer feedback and you need to find patterns and solutions. The bad way? You type "Analyze this data" and paste it in. You get something vague that doesn't help you make decisions.

The good way using the framework. Role: Act as a customer insights analyst. Task: Analyze this customer feedback to identify the top three pain points and recommend two actionable solutions for each. Context: This is feedback from our onboarding process. We have a sixty percent completion rate and want to increase it to eighty percent. Our team has limited technical resources.

Format: Create a table with three columns. Pain point, impact, and recommended solution. Then add a brief summary paragraph. Tone: Data-driven but actionable. Focus on quick wins we can implement now.

When you structure it this way, you get a formatted table that you can literally take straight to your boss or your team meeting. This is what decision-makers want to see. Clear problems, clear solutions, organized professionally.

│  ┌─────────────────────────┐           │

│                         [AVATAR]        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Design Specs:**
- Same framework color-coding
- LinkedIn post: Styled box resembling LinkedIn UI
- Show first 2-3 lines of post
- Font: 22-24pt for post preview

**Visual Enhancement:**
- LinkedIn UI mockup (optional)
- Before: Boring corporate; After: Engaging post

**Speaker Notes:**
```
Example three is content creation. This is where people really struggle because AI content often sounds robotic and corporate. Let me show you how to fix that.

The bad way: "Write a LinkedIn post about AI." What you get is boring corporate speak that nobody wants to read.

The good way with the framework. Role: Act as a thought leader in business innovation with a conversational, slightly provocative style. Notice we're giving it personality here. Task: Write a LinkedIn post about how most companies are using AI wrong. We're being specific and a bit contrarian.

Context: I want to challenge the "AI for everything" approach and argue for focused, practical AI adoption. My audience is mid-level managers and business owners who feel overwhelmed by AI hype. We're telling it exactly who we're writing for.

Format: Hook in the first line. Three short paragraphs with two to three sentences each. End with a thought-provoking question. Use line breaks for readability. And tone: Confident but not arrogant. Conversational but professional. Slightly contrarian.

Now you get content with voice, with personality, with a perspective. This is content people actually want to read and engage with.

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Design Specs:**
- Large, clear layout with 5 rows
- Each row: Icon | Label | Question

- Font: 28-32pt for labels, 24pt for questions
- Bottom tagline: 36pt, bold

**Visual Enhancement:**
- Icons enlarged and colorful
- Clean grid/table layout
- High contrast for memorability

**Speaker Notes:**
```
Let me break down the Five-Part Framework one more time because this is what you need to remember. Five parts, every single time you use AI.

Part one: Role. Who should AI be? Give it expertise. Act as a marketing strategist. Act as a data analyst. Act as a customer service expert. This sets the perspective.

Part two: Task. What exactly do you want? Be specific. Don't say "write an email." Say "write an email declining a meeting invitation while maintaining the relationship."

Part three: Context. Why does this matter? What's the situation? What constraints do you have? This is where you make it personal to your specific needs.

Part four: Format. How should it look? Do you want bullet points? A table? Three paragraphs? Two sentences? Tell it exactly how to structure the output.

Part five: Tone. How should it sound? Professional? Casual? Friendly? Direct? The tone shapes how your message is received.

Five parts. Every time. That's the difference between mediocre AI outputs and results that make you say "Wow, this is actually useful."

**Speaker Notes:**

Now, I know what you're thinking. "This sounds great, but I don't want to write these prompts from scratch every time." I've got you covered.

I created a free resource: twenty-five prompt templates using this exact framework. There are eight categories. Business communication. Data analysis. Content creation. Project management. Learning and research. Customer service. Sales. And productivity.

Each template is ready to use. You just customize the brackets with your specific details and you're done. For example, there's a template for writing proposals. One for analyzing survey data. One for creating social media content. One for preparing for difficult conversations. All of them use the Five-Part Framework.

Here's your challenge. I want you to pick one prompt today. Not tomorrow. Not next week. Today. Try it. Save an hour this week. Because knowing this framework doesn't help you unless you actually use it.

The download link is in the description below. No email required. Just click and download. It's my gift to help you get started immediately.

You now know more than ninety percent of people who claim to be "AI proficient." Most people are still typing "write me an email" and wondering why the results are bad. You're different now. You understand how to communicate with AI effectively.

In the next video, I'm going to show you advanced prompting techniques. Things like chain-of-thought prompting and few-shot learning. These techniques will take you from good to expert level. But everything starts with this framework.
