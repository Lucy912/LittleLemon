## SCENE 1: Hook (0:00-0:15)
**Slide:** Blank prompt box transforming into 10 filled prompts

You know the framework. Now let's write ten prompts together in the next ten minutes. By the end, you'll have a personal prompt library worth thousands of dollars. Real prompts. Real results. Let's build them right now.

**[Word count: 45 words]**

## SCENE 2: Promise & Setup (0:15-1:00)
**Slide:** "What You'll Do Today" with 10 categories

Here's what we're doing. We'll write ten prompts using the Five-Part Framework. We'll cover ten different use cases from your daily work. We'll test them in real time and see results. And you'll build your personal prompt library.

What you'll have when we're done: ten ready-to-use prompts, saved and tested. Framework mastery through repetition. Confidence to write any prompt. And a template for creating unlimited prompts.

Here's the strategy. I'll do the first three prompts with you step-by-step. Then you'll do prompts four through seven on your own while I wait. Then we'll do eight through ten together as advanced practice.

Open ChatGPT or Claude right now. Grab your Five-Part Framework Cheat Sheet from Video Two-One. Download the practice worksheet. And give me ten minutes of focus time. Let's go.

## SCENE 3: Prompt 1 - Email Writing (1:00-2:15)
**Slide:** Framework template with Email example being filled in

Prompt one: email writing. Scenario: you need to follow up on a proposal with no response for two weeks.

Let's build it using the framework. Role: what expertise do we need? Act as a professional communicator skilled at polite persistence. Task: what exactly do we want? Write a follow-up email checking on the status of my proposal.

Context: why does this matter? I sent a proposal two weeks ago, no response. This is a warm lead worth ten thousand euros. I don't want to sound pushy but need an answer. Relationship is professional but friendly.

Format: how should it look? Subject line, two short paragraphs, clear question, professional sign-off. Tone: how should it sound? Friendly and understanding, acknowledging they're busy, gently persistent but not desperate.

Now copy this complete prompt into ChatGPT and press enter. Look at that result. It's polite. It's professional. It's effective. Ready to send. See how each part of the framework shaped the output? That's the power of structure.

## SCENE 4: Prompt 2 - Meeting Prep (2:15-3:15)
**Slide:** Meeting prep framework example

Prompt two: meeting prep. Scenario: you have a meeting with a difficult stakeholder in thirty minutes.

Let's build it. Role: act as an executive coach who prepares leaders for challenging conversations. Task: create a meeting preparation guide for a difficult stakeholder conversation.

Context: stakeholder is skeptical of my project, has shot down ideas before, holds budget approval. Meeting is in thirty minutes. I need to present a new initiative requiring fifty thousand euros investment. Their main concern is ROI.

Format: five bullet points covering key message, their likely objections, my responses, data to emphasize, and closing ask. Tone: strategic and confident, acknowledging their concerns, focused on mutual benefit.

Run it in ChatGPT. Look at that output. It gives you exactly what you need to walk into that meeting prepared. Notice how the context about the skeptical stakeholder shaped the advice? That's why context matters.

**[Word count: 165 words]**

## SCENE 5: Prompt 3 - Data Analysis (3:15-4:15)
**Slide:** Data analysis framework with table output

Prompt three: data analysis. Scenario: you have customer feedback data but don't know what it means.

Building it together. Role: act as a data analyst specializing in customer insights. Task: analyze this customer feedback and identify the top three actionable insights.

Context: we have fifty customer survey responses about our new product. We need to prioritize improvements. Budget is limited so can only tackle three things. Main question: what will have biggest impact on satisfaction?

Format: table with three columns for issue, evidence with quote or data, and recommended action. Then a two-sentence priority explanation. Tone: data-driven and objective, focused on business impact, actionable not academic.

Run it with some sample feedback data. See that structured output? That table is immediately usable in your next team meeting. The format specification created that. Without it, you'd get a paragraph and you'd have to restructure it yourself.

**[Word count: 165 words]**

## SCENE 6: Your Turn - Prompts 4-7 (4:15-5:30)
**Slide:** Timer showing "3 MINUTES - YOUR TURN" with 4 prompts listed

Now it's your turn. You're going to write four prompts on your own. I'll wait.

Prompt four: content creation. Scenario: write a LinkedIn post about a recent achievement. Use the worksheet. Take two minutes.

Prompt five: problem-solving. Scenario: you're stuck on a project roadblock. Use the framework. Take two minutes.

Prompt six: learning and research. Scenario: you need to understand a new concept quickly. Build the prompt. Take two minutes.

Prompt seven: planning and strategy. Scenario: plan your week's priorities. Apply the five parts. Take two minutes.

Pause the video right now. Write these four prompts. Test them. I'll be here when you're ready.

Done? Great! Let's check common mistakes and do three more together.

**[Word count: 145 words]**

## SCENE 7: Common Mistakes Review (5:30-6:00)
**Slide:** Common mistakes with X marks and corrections

Based on prompts four through seven, watch for these mistakes.

Mistake one: vague task. Don't say "help me with content." Say "write a two-hundred-word LinkedIn post." Mistake two: too much context. Not a paragraph of background. Just two to three sentences focused on what AI needs to know.

Mistake three: no format specified. Don't leave format blank. Say "bullet list with five items" or "three paragraphs." Mistake four: boring tone. Not just "professional tone." Say "conversational but credible, warm and encouraging."

Mistake five: wrong role. Not "act as AI." Say "act as a marketing strategist with B2B expertise." Quick fix: if output is bad, check these five parts. Usually one is missing or vague.

## SCENE 8: Advanced Prompts 8-10 (6:00-8:00)
**Slide:** Advanced prompt examples with complexity indicators

Let's do three advanced prompts. Prompt eight: editing and improving existing content. Act as an editor known for making content fifty percent better with minimal changes. Task: improve this email or post or document to be more persuasive or clear or engaging.

Context: original version is too long or too formal or confusing. Audience is your target. Goal is desired action. Constraints: keep it under word count, maintain what to keep. Format: show before-after comparison with three bullet points explaining what changed and why. Tone: in the revised version, make it your desired tone. Then paste your original content. Key learning: AI is excellent at editing when you tell it what to improve and why.

Prompt nine: brainstorming multiple options. Act as a creative strategist who generates diverse, unconventional ideas. Task: brainstorm ten different approaches to your challenge. Context: we've tried what hasn't worked. Constraints are budget, time, resources. Target audience is who. Success looks like outcome. We're open to unconventional ideas. Format: table with four columns for idea name, one-sentence description, pros, and cons. Then rank top three with explanation. Tone: creative but practical, pushing boundaries while staying realistic. Key learning: ask for multiple options plus ranking to get better decisions.

Prompt ten: decision-making support. Act as a strategic advisor who helps people make difficult decisions with confidence. Task: help me decide between option A and option B for situation. Context: option A equals description with pros and cons. Option B equals description with pros and cons. My constraints are time, budget, risk tolerance. My values are what matters most. Unknowns are what I'm uncertain about. Format: one, reframe the decision. Two, comparison table with criteria and ratings. Three, risk analysis for each. Four, recommended choice with reasoning. Five, what data would change this recommendation. Tone: objective and analytical, but acknowledging the emotional aspect of decisions. Key learning: the more context about constraints and values, the better the decision support.

## SCENE 9: Review Your Library (8:00-9:00)
**Slide:** All 10 prompts with checkmarks

Look at what you now have. Email writing template. Meeting prep template. Data analysis template. Content creation template that you wrote. Problem-solving template that you wrote. Learning and research template that you wrote. Planning and strategy template that you wrote. Editing and improvement template. Brainstorming template. And decision-making template.

This library is worth thousands because each prompt saves fifteen to forty-five minutes per use. Use them two to three times per week and you save three to five hours weekly. Reuse them for months or years. Customize them for your specific needs. Share them with your team and multiply the value.

Next step: save these ten prompts somewhere you'll actually use them. Your notes app on your phone. A Notion or Obsidian page. Printed cheat sheet on your desk. Bookmarks in your browser. Or an AI prompt management tool like PromptBox.

## SCENE 10: Mastery Path & Challenge (9:00-10:00)
**Slide:** Mastery progression chart and call-to-action

You've now written ten prompts using the framework. Here's the mastery formula. Prompts one through ten: you're learning. That's today. Prompts eleven through twenty-five: you're practicing. That's this week. Prompts twenty-six through fifty: you're proficient. That's this month. Prompts fifty-one through one hundred: you're expert. The framework becomes automatic.

Your challenge: use all ten prompts at least once this week. Note which ones save you the most time. Customize them for your specific needs. Create five more prompts for tasks unique to your role. By next week, you'll have fifteen prompts and you'll be in the top one percent of AI users.

Download the worksheet. It includes all ten prompts plus blank templates for your custom prompts. Next video: advanced prompting techniques like chain-of-thought and few-shot learning.
