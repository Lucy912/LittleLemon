## Video Outline (Talking Points)

### [0:00-0:15] HOOK
"You have your audit. Now let's turn it into a 90-day roadmap that takes you from AI beginner to power user—with measurable wins every two weeks."

**Visual:** Audit document transforming into calendar roadmap with milestone markers

---

### [0:15-0:45] WHY YOU NEED A ROADMAP

**The problem without a plan:**
- Audit sits in drawer, never executed
- Enthusiasm fades after Week 1
- No accountability or measurement
- Random AI usage instead of systematic improvement

**What a roadmap gives you:**
- Clear milestones every 2 weeks
- Accountability checkpoints
- Measurement framework (prove ROI)
- Sustainable pace (not burnout sprint)
- Strategic progression (simple → advanced)

**The 90-day framework:**
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2):** Quick wins + habit formation
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 3-6):** High-value tasks + skill building
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 7-12):** Optimization + expansion
- Result: 8-10 hours/week saved, AI mastery achieved

**This video gives you the roadmap template. You'll complete it in 10 minutes after watching.**

---

### [0:45-2:00] PHASE 1: QUICK WINS (Weeks 1-2)

**Goal:** Build momentum with immediate wins

**What to do:**
1. Implement 3-5 Tier 1 quick wins from your audit
2. Use prompts from Module 2 (don't create new ones yet)
3. Track time savings daily
4. Build AI habits (use consistently)

**Week 1 focus:**
- **Day 1:** Start Quick Wins #1-3
- **Day 2-3:** Apply to real work, note challenges
- **Day 4:** Adjust prompts if needed (quality issues)
- **Day 5:** Measure time saved vs. baseline

**Week 2 focus:**
- **Continue** all quick wins
- **Refine** prompts based on results
- **Expand** to Quick Wins #4-5 if ready
- **Document** what's working

**Success metrics for Week 2:**
- ✅ Used AI for target tasks 80%+ of the time
- ✅ Time saved: 3-5 hours/week (measured)
- ✅ Quality maintained or improved
- ✅ Comfort level increased

**Common Week 1-2 challenges:**
- 🚧 Prompts don't work perfectly first try → Iterate, use refinement techniques
- 🚧 Takes longer than expected initially → Learning curve, speed comes Week 2
- 🚧 Forgot to use AI for task → Set reminders, build triggers
- 🚧 Quality wasn't quite right → Adjust prompts, add more context

**Checkpoint: End of Week 2**

Stop and evaluate:
- What's the actual time saved? (Track honestly)
- Which quick wins delivered most value?
- What prompts need refinement?
- Am I ready for Phase 2?

**Don't move to Phase 2 until quick wins are consistent.**

---

### [2:00-3:30] PHASE 2: HIGH-VALUE TASKS (Weeks 3-6)

**Goal:** Expand to more complex, higher-impact opportunities

**What to do:**
1. Implement 5-8 Tier 2 high-value tasks

**Success metrics for Week 6:**
- ✅ Total time saved: 6-8 hours/week (cumulative)
- ✅ Using AI for 10-12 different task types
- ✅ Prompts refined and reliable
- ✅ Confidence in advanced techniques

**Common Week 3-6 challenges:**
- 🚧 Complex tasks need more prompt work → Use Chain-of-Thought, break into steps
- 🚧 Quality varies batch to batch → Add more context, specify format better
- 🚧 Too many tasks at once → Scale back, consolidate before adding more
- 🚧 Team questions your AI use → Share results data, offer to help them

---

### [5:00-5:30] COMMON ROADMAP MISTAKES

**Mistake 1: Too Aggressive Timeline**
❌ Trying to do all 12 weeks in 4 weeks
✅ Follow the phased approach (habit formation takes time)

**Fix:** If you're behind schedule, that's okay. Extend the timeline. Slow and steady wins.

---

**Mistake 2: No Measurement**
❌ "I think I'm saving time..."
✅ "I saved 6.3 hours this week, here's the data"

**Fix:** Track weekly. Takes 5 minutes. Proves ROI. Maintains motivation.

---

**Mistake 3: Perfectionism Paralysis**
❌ "I won't use AI until my prompts are perfect"
✅ "I'll start with good enough, iterate to great"

**Fix:** Launch Week 1 quick wins even if prompts aren't perfect. Refinement happens through use.

---

**Mistake 4: Abandoning After Setbacks**
❌ "AI didn't work perfectly, I'm giving up"
✅ "This didn't work, let me adjust and try again"

**Fix:** Expect iterations. Week 1 is experimentation. Week 2-3 is refinement. Week 4+ is mastery.

---

**Mistake 5: Not Celebrating Wins**
❌ Moving straight to next task without acknowledging progress
✅ "I saved 4 hours this week—that's half a workday back!"

**Fix:** End every Friday with wins review. Acknowledge progress. Builds momentum.

---

TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

IF YOU'RE BEHIND SCHEDULE:
→ That's normal! Extend timeline, don't abandon
→ Focus on quality over speed
→ Reduce number of tasks if needed

IF PROMPTS AREN'T WORKING:
→ Review Module 2 techniques
→ Add more context to prompts
→ Use Chain-of-Thought for complex tasks
→ Iterate (don't expect perfection first try)

IF QUALITY IS INCONSISTENT:
→ Add specific format requirements
→ Provide more context
→ Use Few-Shot examples
→ Edit and refine (AI drafts, you perfect)

IF YOU'RE NOT SEEING TIME SAVINGS:
→ Are you tracking accurately? (measure honestly)
→ Learning curve? (Week 1-2 may be slower)
→ Wrong tasks chosen? (re-evaluate AI suitability scores)
→ Need more prompt refinement? (iterate more)

IF MOTIVATION IS WANING:
→ Review wins from previous weeks
→ Calculate cumulative time saved
→ Share progress with someone
→ Take a week off if needed (then resume)
