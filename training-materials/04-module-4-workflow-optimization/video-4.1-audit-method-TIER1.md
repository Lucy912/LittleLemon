### [0:45-2:00] THE 5-STEP AUDIT METHOD

**Overview of the process:**

**Step 1:** Capture your tasks (what you actually do)
**Step 2:** Score AI potential (which tasks AI can help with)
**Step 3:** Prioritize by impact (biggest wins first)
**Step 4:** Identify quick wins (start here)
**Step 5:** Create action plan (what to do when)

**Total time:** 20 minutes if you follow the template

**Output:** Prioritized list of 8-12 AI opportunities + 90-day implementation plan

---

### [2:00-3:00] STEP 1: CAPTURE YOUR TASKS

**Goal:** List everything you do in a typical week.

**The method:** Task dump (brain dump of work activities)

**Instructions:**
1. Set timer for 5 minutes
2. List every task type you do regularly
3. Don't filter or judge—just capture
4. Include:
   - Daily recurring tasks
   - Weekly/monthly tasks
   - Project work
   - Admin/overhead
   - Communication

**Categories to prompt your thinking:**
- 📧 **Communication:** Emails, Slack, meetings, phone calls
- 📝 **Content Creation:** Writing, presentations, reports, social posts
- 📊 **Analysis:** Data review, research, competitive analysis, reporting
- 🎨 **Creative:** Design, brainstorming, strategy, planning
- ⚙️ **Operations:** Scheduling, filing, data entry, process tasks
- 🎓 **Learning:** Research, reading, skill development
- 👥 **People:** 1-on-1s, reviews, hiring, team coordination

**Example task list:**
```
□ Write customer emails (responses to inquiries)
□ Create weekly status reports
□ Prepare meeting agendas
□ Review and analyze sales data
□ Draft social media posts
□ Schedule team meetings
□ Conduct job interviews
□ Write product documentation
□ Research competitors
□ Prepare client presentations
□ Review team work/code
□ Fill out expense reports
□ Create training materials
[... continue for 20-40 tasks]
```

**Pro tip:** Track one actual day in detail if you can't remember everything.

**Time for Step 1:** 5 minutes → You now have 20-40 tasks listed

---

### [3:00-4:30] STEP 2: SCORE AI POTENTIAL

**Goal:** Determine which tasks AI can actually help with.

**The 3 scoring criteria (1-5 scale for each):**

**Criteria 1: Time Spent**
- 5 = Takes >2 hours per week
- 4 = Takes 1-2 hours per week
- 3 = Takes 30 min - 1 hour per week
- 2 = Takes 15-30 min per week
- 1 = Takes <15 min per week

**Criteria 2: AI Suitability**
- 5 = AI can do 80-100% of this task
- 4 = AI can do 50-80%
- 3 = AI can do 25-50%
- 2 = AI can do 10-25%
- 1 = AI can barely help (<10%)

**Criteria 3: Repetitiveness**
- 5 = Do this daily
- 4 = Do this 3-5x per week
- 3 = Do this weekly
- 2 = Do this 2-3x per month
- 1 = Do this monthly or less

**How to assess AI suitability (Criteria 2):**

**High AI suitability (4-5):**
- ✅ Writing first drafts (emails, documents, posts)
- ✅ Summarizing content (meetings, articles, data)
- ✅ Data analysis & pattern finding
- ✅ Brainstorming & ideation
- ✅ Research & information gathering
- ✅ Formatting & restructuring content
- ✅ Creating templates and frameworks

**Medium AI suitability (2-3):**
- ≈ Strategic planning (AI assists, you decide)
- ≈ Quality review (AI suggests, you judge)
- ≈ Creative work requiring brand voice
- ≈ Complex problem-solving
- ≈ Relationship-building communication

**Low AI suitability (1):**
- ❌ High-stakes final decisions
- ❌ Emotional/sensitive conversations
- ❌ Tasks requiring deep domain expertise
- ❌ Physical work
- ❌ Real-time interactive work (live presentations, negotiations)

**Scoring example:**
```
Task: "Write customer emails (responses to inquiries)"
• Time Spent: 4 (1-2 hours/week, ~20-30 emails)
• AI Suitability: 5 (AI can draft 90%, I edit/personalize)
• Repetitiveness: 5 (daily task)
• TOTAL SCORE: 14/15
→ HIGH PRIORITY for AI optimization
```

**Another example:**
```
Task: "Conduct job interviews"
• Time Spent: 3 (30-60 min/week)
• AI Suitability: 2 (AI can help prep questions, not conduct interview)
• Repetitiveness: 3 (weekly)
• TOTAL SCORE: 8/15
→ MEDIUM PRIORITY (AI helps prep, not main task)
```

**Go through your entire task list and score each one.**

**Time for Step 2:** 10 minutes → All tasks now scored

---

### [4:30-5:30] STEP 3: PRIORITIZE BY IMPACT

**Goal:** Identify the highest-value opportunities.

**The impact formula:**
```
IMPACT SCORE = Total Score × Estimated Time Saved

Where:
• Total Score = (Time Spent + AI Suitability + Repetitiveness)
• Estimated Time Saved = % time reduction × current time spent
```

**Example calculation:**
```
Task: "Write customer emails"
• Total Score: 14/15
• Current time: 90 min/week
• AI can save: 60% → 54 min/week saved
• IMPACT SCORE: 14 × 54 = 756
```

**Simplified method (if math feels tedious):**
Just rank by Total Score, then estimate time savings for top 10.

**Create priority tiers:**

**TIER 1: Quick Wins (Total Score 12-15)**
- High scores across all criteria
- Start here (immediate ROI)
- Typically 3-5 tasks

**TIER 2: High Value (Total Score 9-11)**
- Good opportunities, slightly more effort
- Implement after quick wins
- Typically 5-8 tasks

**TIER 3: Worth Exploring (Total Score 6-8)**
- Marginal benefit or requires more work
- Consider after Tier 1 & 2 complete
- May not be worth the effort

**TIER 4: Low Priority (Total Score <6)**
- Skip these for now
- Not enough benefit to justify time investment
- Revisit in 6 months if other opportunities exhausted

**Sort your tasks by Total Score.**
**Identify your Tier 1 Quick Wins (top 3-5 tasks).**

**Time for Step 3:** 3 minutes → Tasks now prioritized

---

### [5:30-6:30] STEP 4: IDENTIFY QUICK WINS

**Goal:** Find the easiest high-impact opportunities to start with.

**Quick Win criteria:**
1. High Total Score (12-15)
2. You already know how to use AI for this (prompts from Module 2)
3. Low risk (not client-facing or high-stakes)
4. Can implement in <1 hour

**Example quick wins:**
- ✅ Email responses (use email prompt from Module 2)
- ✅ Meeting notes (summarize with AI)
- ✅ Social media drafts (content creation prompts)
- ✅ Data summaries (analysis prompts)
- ✅ First drafts of anything

**For each Tier 1 task, ask:**
- Do I have a prompt ready for this? (From Module 2 library)
- Can I start using AI for this task tomorrow?
- Is the risk low enough to experiment?

**If YES to all three → It's a Quick Win. Start here.**

**Your Quick Win action items:**
```
Quick Win #1: [Task name]
• Prompt to use: [Specific prompt from Module 2]
• When I'll start: [This week / Tomorrow / Specific date]
• Success metric: [Time saved / Quality improved / Frequency]
• Estimated time savings: [X min/week]

Quick Win #2: [...]
Quick Win #3: [...]
```

**Aim for 3-5 quick wins to implement in Week 1.**

**Time for Step 4:** 2 minutes → Quick wins identified

---

### [6:30-7:15] STEP 5: CREATE ACTION PLAN

**Goal:** Turn audit into executable 90-day plan.

**The 90-day framework:**

**WEEK 1-2: Quick Wins (Tier 1)**
- Implement 3-5 quick win tasks
- Build habits (use AI consistently for these tasks)
- Measure time savings
- Adjust prompts based on results

**WEEK 3-6: High Value Tasks (Tier 2)**
- Implement next 5-8 tasks
- May require custom prompt development
- Some experimentation needed
- Refine based on quality and speed

**WEEK 7-12: Optimization & Expansion**
- Optimize existing AI workflows (iterative refinement)
- Explore Tier 3 opportunities (if capacity)
- Share learnings with team
- Identify next wave of opportunities

**Action plan template:**
```
WEEK 1-2: QUICK WINS
□ [Task 1]: Use [prompt], start [date], track [metric]
□ [Task 2]: Use [prompt], start [date], track [metric]
□ [Task 3]: Use [prompt], start [date], track [metric]

WEEK 3-6: HIGH VALUE
□ [Task 4]: Develop custom prompt, test, refine
□ [Task 5]: ...
□ [Task 6]: ...

WEEK 7-12: OPTIMIZE
□ Review time savings so far
□ Refine prompts that need improvement
□ Identify next opportunities
□ Share wins with team
```

**Success tracking:**
- Track time saved per task per week
- Note quality improvements
- Document what's working / what's not
- Adjust plan based on results

**Time for Step 5:** 5 minutes → 90-day plan created

---

### [7:15-7:45] COMMON AUDIT MISTAKES

**Mistake 1: Too Many Tasks at Once**
❌ Trying to AI-optimize 20 tasks in week 1
✅ Start with 3-5 quick wins, build from there

**Why:** Habit formation requires focus. Better to do 5 tasks well than 20 poorly.

---

**Mistake 2: Starting with Hardest Tasks**
❌ Beginning with complex, high-stakes work
✅ Start with low-risk, high-frequency tasks

**Why:** Quick wins build confidence and skills before tackling harder tasks.

---

**Mistake 3: No Measurement**
❌ "I think AI is helping..."
✅ "AI saved me 4.5 hours this week on email responses"

**Why:** Measurement shows ROI, motivates continuation, identifies what works.

---

**Mistake 4: Perfect Prompts on First Try**
❌ Expecting immediate perfection
✅ Iterating and refining over 2-3 weeks

**Why:** AI workflows improve with practice and adjustment.

---

**Mistake 5: Audit and Forget**
❌ Complete audit, never look at it again
✅ Review weekly, update monthly, re-audit quarterly

**Why:** Work changes, AI capabilities evolve, new opportunities emerge.
