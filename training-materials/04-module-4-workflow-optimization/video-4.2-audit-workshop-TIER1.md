| 10 | Customer feedback analysis | 2 | 5 | 3 | **10** | 25 min/wk |

**Let me explain a few:**

**Task #1: Customer inquiry emails (Score: 14/15)**
- Time: 4 (1-2 hours/week, ~30 emails)
- AI: 5 (AI can draft 90%, I personalize 10%)
- Reps: 5 (Every single day)
- **Why high AI suitability:** Email responses follow patterns, AI excels at this

**Task #2: Blog posts (Score: 12/15)**
- Time: 5 (2-3 hours/week)
- AI: 4 (AI drafts 60%, I edit heavily for voice)
- Reps: 3 (Weekly task)

**Task #8: Campaign ideation (Score: 9/15)**
- Time: 3 (30-60 min/week)
- AI: 3 (AI suggests ideas, I evaluate and select)
- Reps: 3 (Weekly brainstorms)

2. Social media content (14) - 50 min/wk savings
3. Blog posts (12) - 90 min/wk savings
4. Meeting notes & follow-ups (12) - 35 min/wk savings

### [9:45-10:00] WRAP & NEXT STEPS

**You did it! 🎉**

**What you now have:**
- ✅ Complete task inventory (20-40 tasks)
- ✅ Each task scored and prioritized
- ✅ 3-5 quick wins identified for Week 1
- ✅ 90-day implementation roadmap
- ✅ Potential: 5-10+ hours/week time savings

**Your homework:**
1. **Today:** Review your plan, make any final adjustments
2. **Tomorrow:** Start Quick Win #1
3. **This week:** Implement all 3-5 quick wins
4. **End of Week 1:** Measure actual time saved
5. **End of Week 2:** Checkpoint review, adjust as needed

**Success tips:**
- Start small (3-5 quick wins, not all 23 tasks)
- Measure consistently (track time saved weekly)
- Iterate prompts (first version won't be perfect)
- Build habits (use AI consistently for these tasks)
- Celebrate wins (acknowledge time savings)

**What's next:**
