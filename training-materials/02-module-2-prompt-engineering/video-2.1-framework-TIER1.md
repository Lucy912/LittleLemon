## Video Outline (Talking Points)

### [0:00-0:15] HOOK
"The difference between 'AI is useless' and 'AI is magic' is 5 words. I'll show you which 5 words in the next 8 minutes."

**Visual:** Bad output vs. Amazing output, highlight the 5 framework elements

---

### [0:15-0:45] PROMISE
**What you'll learn:**
1. Why most AI prompts fail (missing these 5 parts)
2. The 5-Part Framework that works every time
3. How to apply it to ANY task

**What you'll be able to do:**
- Turn vague ideas into precise prompts
- Get consistent, high-quality AI outputs
- Never stare at a blank prompt box again

---

### [0:45-2:30] WHY MOST PROMPTS FAIL

**Common Bad Prompts:**

"Help me with marketing"
- ❌ Too vague
- ❌ No context
- ❌ No desired format
- Result: Generic, useless output

"Write a blog post"
- ❌ Missing topic specifics
- ❌ No audience definition
- ❌ No tone guidance
- Result: Bland, robotic content

"Analyze this data"
- ❌ No analysis goal
- ❌ No output structure
- ❌ No actionability requirement
- Result: Surface-level insights

**The Problem:** AI needs structure. Without it, it guesses.

**The Solution:** Give AI exactly what it needs to succeed.

### [2:30-6:00] THE 5-PART FRAMEWORK (Deep Dive)

**Part 1: ROLE** 🎭 (Who should AI be?)

**Why it matters:**
- AI adopts expertise and perspective
- Shapes the knowledge it draws from
- Influences language and depth

**Good examples:**
- "Act as a marketing strategist"
- "Act as a data analyst with 10 years experience"
- "Act as a teacher explaining to beginners"
- "Act as a CFO reviewing a proposal"

**Bad examples:**
- "You are AI" (too generic)
- No role specified (AI picks randomly)

**Quick Tip:** Match role to your needs. Technical task? Technical role. Creative task? Creative role.

---

**Part 2: TASK** 🎯 (What exactly do you want?)

**Why it matters:**
- Defines the deliverable
- Sets clear boundaries
- Prevents scope creep

**Good examples:**
- "Write a 300-word product description"
- "Create a 5-step process for onboarding"
- "Analyze these 50 customer reviews and identify top 3 complaints"

**Bad examples:**
- "Help with product" (what kind of help?)
- "Do something with reviews" (what output?)

**Quick Tip:** Use action verbs: Write, Create, Analyze, Summarize, List, Compare, Design, Plan

---

**Part 3: CONTEXT** 📋 (Why does this matter?)

**Why it matters:**
- Provides background AI can't guess
- Influences relevance of output
- Enables nuanced responses

**Good examples:**
- "Context: This is for a B2B SaaS company selling to CFOs. Our main differentiator is security."
- "Context: I'm presenting to a skeptical board who thinks AI is overhyped. I need data-driven arguments."
- "Context: Budget is tight ($500), timeline is urgent (2 weeks), team is non-technical."

**Bad examples:**
- No context (AI makes assumptions)
- Too much context (irrelevant details)

**Quick Tip:** Answer: Who's this for? What constraints exist? What's the goal?

---

**Part 4: FORMAT** 📐 (How should it look?)

**Why it matters:**
- Defines structure and organization
- Makes output immediately usable
- Prevents reformatting work

**Good examples:**
- "Format: Table with 3 columns: Feature, Benefit, Pricing"
- "Format: Executive summary (3 sentences), then 5 bullet points, then recommendation"
- "Format: Email with subject line, greeting, 3 paragraphs, call-to-action, sign-off"

**Bad examples:**
- "Make it look good" (subjective)
- No format specified (AI picks randomly)

**Quick Tip:** Be specific: table, list, paragraph, email, report, code, JSON, etc.

---

**Part 5: TONE** 🎨 (How should it sound?)

**Why it matters:**
- Matches your brand/voice
- Sets appropriate formality
- Influences emotional resonance

**Good examples:**
- "Tone: Conversational but professional, warm and encouraging"
- "Tone: Direct and data-driven, confident but not arrogant"
- "Tone: Friendly and casual, like talking to a friend over coffee"
- "Tone: Formal and authoritative, appropriate for legal context"

**Bad examples:**
- "Sound good" (subjective)
- "Be nice" (vague)
- No tone (AI defaults to neutral/boring)

**Quick Tip:** Describe it like you would to a writer: professional, casual, witty, serious, warm, direct

---

### [6:00-7:00] FRAMEWORK IN ACTION (Before/After)

**Example: Marketing Email**

**BAD PROMPT:**
"Write an email about our new product"

**Result:** Generic, boring, unusable

**GOOD PROMPT (5-Part Framework):**
```
🎭 ROLE: Act as a marketing copywriter known for concise, benefit-focused messaging.

🎯 TASK: Write a product launch email.

📋 CONTEXT: We're launching an AI-powered scheduling tool for busy executives. Main benefit: saves 5 hours/week. Target audience: C-level execs at tech companies. They're skeptical of "another tool."

📐 FORMAT: Subject line + preview text + 3 short paragraphs (2-3 sentences each) + single clear CTA button text.

🎨 TONE: Confident but not salesy, data-driven, acknowledging their skepticism.
```

**Result:** Specific, on-brand, ready to use

**Show both outputs side-by-side**

---

### [7:00-8:00] RECAP & PRACTICE

**The 5-Part Framework:**

1. 🎭 **ROLE** - Who should AI be?
2. 🎯 **TASK** - What exactly do you want?
3. 📋 **CONTEXT** - Why does this matter?
4. 📐 **FORMAT** - How should it look?
5. 🎨 **TONE** - How should it sound?

**Use it for EVERYTHING:**
- Writing (emails, content, docs)
- Analysis (data, feedback, reports)
- Planning (projects, strategies, processes)
- Problem-solving (brainstorming, decisions, solutions)

**Your Challenge:**
Take one prompt you used this week that gave bad results. Rewrite it with the 5-Part Framework. Watch the quality transform.

**Download:** Framework Cheat Sheet
- 1-page reference
- Examples for each part
- Template to fill in

**Next video:** Write your first 10 prompts (hands-on practice)

**CTA:** Comment: What's the first prompt you'll improve?

✓ Example:
  "Context: This is for B2B SaaS selling to CFOs.
