---

### [5:45-6:15] COMMON MISTAKES REVIEW

**Based on prompts 4-7, watch for these:**

**Mistake 1: Vague Task**
- ❌ "Help me with content"
- ✅ "Write a 200-word LinkedIn post"

**Mistake 2: Too Much Context**
- ❌ Paragraph of background details
- ✅ 2-3 sentences, focused on what AI needs to know

**Mistake 3: No Format Specified**
- ❌ Leaving format blank
- ✅ "Bullet list, 5 items" or "3 paragraphs"

**Mistake 4: Boring Tone**
- ❌ "Professional tone"
- ✅ "Conversational but credible, warm and encouraging"

**Mistake 5: Wrong Role**
- ❌ "Act as AI" (too generic)
- ✅ "Act as a marketing strategist with B2B expertise"

**Quick Fix:** If output is bad, check these 5 parts. Usually one is missing or vague.

---

### [6:15-8:00] ADVANCED PROMPTS 8-10 (Guided - Higher Difficulty)

**PROMPT 8: Editing/Improving Existing Content**

**Scenario:** You wrote something but it's not quite right.

```
Act as an editor known for making content 50% better with minimal changes.

Task: Improve this [email/post/document] to be more [specific goal: persuasive/clear/engaging].

Context: Original version is [what's wrong: too long/too formal/confusing]. Audience is [who]. Goal is [desired action]. Constraints: Keep it under [word count], maintain [what to keep].

Format: Show before/after comparison with 3 bullet points explaining what changed and why.

Tone: In the revised version, make it [desired tone].

[Paste original content here]
```

**KEY LEARNING:** AI is excellent at editing when you tell it WHAT to improve and WHY.

---

**PROMPT 9: Brainstorming Multiple Options**

**Scenario:** You need creative ideas, not just one answer.

```
Act as a creative strategist who generates diverse, unconventional ideas.

Task: Brainstorm 10 different approaches to [your challenge].

Context: We've tried [what hasn't worked]. Constraints are [budget/time/resources]. Target audience is [who]. Success looks like [outcome]. We're open to unconventional ideas.

Format: Table with 4 columns: Idea Name, Description (1 sentence), Pros, Cons. Then rank top 3 with explanation.

Tone: Creative but practical, pushing boundaries while staying realistic.
```

**KEY LEARNING:** Ask for multiple options + ranking to get better decisions.

---

**PROMPT 10: Decision-Making Support**

**Scenario:** You're stuck between two choices and need clarity.

```
Act as a strategic advisor who helps people make difficult decisions with confidence.

Task: Help me decide between [Option A] and [Option B] for [situation].

Context: Option A = [description, pros, cons]. Option B = [description, pros, cons]. My constraints: [time/budget/risk tolerance]. My values: [what matters most]. Unknowns: [what I'm uncertain about].

Format:
1) Reframe the decision (is this the right question?)
2) Comparison table (criteria, A rating, B rating)
3) Risk analysis for each
4) Recommended choice with reasoning
5) What data would change this recommendation?

Tone: Objective and analytical, but acknowledging the emotional aspect of decisions.
```

**KEY LEARNING:** The more context about constraints and values, the better the decision support.

## Production Notes

### Recording Tips:
- Actually PAUSE for 30 seconds when asking viewers to write prompts 4-7
- Show timer on screen during pause
- Keep energy high - this is a workout, not a lecture
- Type out prompts on screen in real-time (screen capture)

### Visual Elements:
- Framework reminder graphic (always visible)
- Split screen: prompt on left, output on right
- Highlight each framework part in its designated color
- Progress tracker: "3/10 prompts complete"

### Editing Focus:
- Fast pace - this should feel active
- Show actual ChatGPT interface (screen recording)
- Cut down wait time when running prompts
- Add on-screen text for key mistakes to avoid

### Engagement Hooks:
- "Pause the video and try this yourself" (at prompts 4-7)
- "Screenshot this prompt for later use"
- "Comment which prompt saved you the most time"

---

## Key Messages

1. **Practice creates mastery:** Framework becomes automatic after 10-25 uses
2. **Each prompt is reusable:** Build once, use hundreds of times
3. **Customization is key:** These are templates, adapt to your needs
4. **Time compounds:** 10 prompts × 20 min saved each × weekly use = massive ROI

---

**PRODUCTION TARGET: 2-3 hours**
- Prep: 30 min (prepare ChatGPT examples)
- Record: 60 min (pause for student work)
- Edit: 45 min (show screen captures clearly)
- Deliverable (worksheet): 45 min (multi-page PDF)

**OUTCOME: Students have 10 tested, working prompts and confidence to create unlimited more**
