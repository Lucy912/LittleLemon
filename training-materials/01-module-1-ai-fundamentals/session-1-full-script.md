- Right: Same quality email, timestamp shows "4 minutes"
- Quick montage flashes (0.5 sec each): ChatGPT output, data table, social post

**AUDIO:** Upbeat but professional music bed (low volume)

**SCRIPT:**
```
Last month, I spent 45 minutes writing a client proposal.

[Pause, let it land]

This week? The same quality proposal in 4 minutes.

[Screen shows both proposals side by side]

I'm going to show you the exact method I used—and you can try it in the next 10 minutes.
```

**ON-SCREEN TEXT:**

Just 10 minutes and a free ChatGPT account.

Let's dive in.
```

**ON-SCREEN GRAPHICS:**
- Bullet 1: ✅ "5-Part Prompt Framework"
- Bullet 2: ✅ "3 Real Examples"
- Bullet 3: ✅ "25 Free Templates"
- Cross-outs: ❌ "NO coding required" ❌ "NO expensive tools" ❌ "NO AI degree"

**EDITING NOTES:**

- Pattern interrupt: Transition whoosh to screen recording

---

### [0:45 - 2:00] CONTEXT & PROBLEM SETUP

**VISUAL:** Full screen - Split view showing bad vs good prompts
- Left side: Bad prompt example
- Right side: Good prompt example (initially blank)
- ChatGPT interface visible

**SCRIPT:**
```
Here's the problem most people have with ChatGPT.

[Type on left side: "Write me a business email"]

They write something like: "Write me a business email."

[ChatGPT outputs generic email on left]

And they get something generic. Something that sounds like... well, AI.

[Read a line from the bad output, in a robotic tone]
"Dear Sir or Madam, I hope this email finds you well..."

So they think: "This isn't helpful. I could write better myself."

And they're RIGHT.

[Pause]

But here's what they're missing:

[Both sides clear, focus on center of screen]

The difference between "AI is useless" and "AI just saved me 10 hours" comes down to one thing:

[Text appears in center]
"How you ask."

Let me show you exactly what I mean.

[Transition to ChatGPT interface, full screen]

This is the 5-Part Prompt Framework.

It's stupid simple, but wildly effective.

[Framework appears as animated list, each item pops in]

Part 1: ROLE - Who should ChatGPT be?
Part 2: TASK - What exactly do you want?
Part 3: CONTEXT - Why does this matter?
Part 4: FORMAT - How should it look?
Part 5: TONE - How should it sound?

Each part tells ChatGPT something it needs to give you exactly what you want.

Not close. Not "pretty good." Exactly what you want.

Let me show you how it works with three real examples.
```

**ON-SCREEN GRAPHICS:**
- Split screen: Bad prompt left, good result (coming) right
- Bad output highlighted with sad face emoji
- Framework list animates in:
  1. 🎭 ROLE
  2. 🎯 TASK
  3. 📋 CONTEXT
  4. 📐 FORMAT
  5. 🎨 TONE

**EDITING NOTES:**
- Typing appears to be real-time but is sped up 1.5x
- Robot voice filter on "Dear Sir or Madam" line (subtle, for humor)
- Music becomes more thoughtful/curious
- Framework animation: Each item slides in from right
- Pattern interrupt at 1:58: Music shift + screen zoom to ChatGPT interface

---

### [2:00 - 3:30] EXAMPLE 1 - BUSINESS EMAIL

**VISUAL:** Full screen ChatGPT interface
- Cursor visible
- Type prompts in real-time (or appear to be real-time)

**SCRIPT:**
```
Example number one: Writing a business email.

Let's say you need to decline a meeting invitation. Professionally.

Here's how most people would prompt ChatGPT:

[Type slowly, one letter at a time effect]
"Write an email declining a meeting"

[Hit enter, wait for result]

[Show generic result, scroll through it]

Generic. Awkward. Doesn't sound like you.

Now watch what happens when we use the framework.

[Clear chat, start fresh]

I'm going to type this out so you can see each part.

[Type, pausing between each section]

"Act as a busy professional who values relationships.

Task: Write an email declining a meeting invitation.

Context: The meeting is with a vendor I want to maintain good relations with. I'm declining because our budget is frozen this quarter, but I want to leave the door open for future collaboration.

Format: Professional email, 3-4 sentences maximum.

Tone: Warm but direct, apologetic but not over-explaining."

[Hit enter]

Now look at this.

[Result appears, scroll through slowly]

[Read first two sentences aloud]

"Thanks for thinking of us for this project. Unfortunately, we're in a budget freeze this quarter and can't commit to new vendors right now. That said, I'd love to reconnect in Q2 when we're planning for the year ahead. Would that work for you?"

See the difference?

This sounds human. It's specific to your situation. I could copy-paste this right now and send it.

You're not spending 15 minutes agonizing over how to say no politely.

Four minutes. And it's better than what you would have written.

Let's try another one.
```

**ON-SCREEN ANNOTATIONS:**
- As each part of framework is typed, highlight it in different color:
  - ROLE = Blue
  - TASK = Green
  - CONTEXT = Purple
  - FORMAT = Orange
  - TONE = Red
- Small comparison box in top-right corner: "Before vs After"
- Timer graphic: "Time saved: 11 minutes"

**PAUSE POINT [3:25]:**
```
Before we continue—pause the video right now and try this yourself.

[Full screen text appears: "PAUSE AND TRY IT"]

Open ChatGPT. Use the framework. Write a business email you actually need.

I'll wait.

[3-second pause - timer counts down 3, 2, 1]

Okay, moving on.
```

**EDITING NOTES:**
- Typing speed: Natural but edited to remove pauses
- Highlight each framework part as it's typed
- Zoom in slightly on the ChatGPT output
- Enthusiastic tone when showing good result
- Pattern interrupt at 3:30: Quick transition sound effect

---

### [3:30 - 5:00] EXAMPLE 2 - DATA ANALYSIS

**VISUAL:** Split screen - spreadsheet (left) and ChatGPT (right)
- Spreadsheet shows sample data (can be mock customer feedback)
- Data is readable but not too detailed

**SCRIPT:**
```
Example number two: Analyzing data or making decisions.

Here's the scenario: You have customer feedback data and you need to find patterns.

Maybe you're a product manager, maybe you run a small business, maybe you're in customer support.

Doesn't matter. Same problem.

The lazy prompt:

[Type in ChatGPT]
"Analyze this data"

[Paste some generic data]

[Show weak result - just lists obvious points]

Okay, that's... not helpful. You could have figured that out yourself.

Now, the framework prompt.

[Clear chat]

[Type each part deliberately]

"Act as a customer insights analyst.

Task: Analyze this customer feedback to identify the top 3 pain points and recommend 2 actionable solutions for each.

Context: This is feedback from our onboarding process. We have a 60% completion rate and want to increase it to 80%. Our team has limited technical resources.

Format: Create a table with 3 columns: Pain Point, Impact (High/Medium/Low), Recommended Solution. Then add a brief summary paragraph.

Tone: Data-driven but actionable. Focus on quick wins."

[Paste the same data from before]

[Hit enter, wait for response]

Okay, look at this.

[Scroll through the result - it's a well-formatted table]

It's not just "here are some insights."

It's structured. It's prioritized. It's actionable.

[Read one pain point and solution aloud]

"Pain point one: Users don't understand step 3 of the onboarding process. Impact: High. Recommended solution: Add a 30-second video tutorial at this step, or simplify the UI to reduce fields from 8 to 4."

This is the kind of output your boss or client actually wants to see.

You just went from "here's what people said" to "here's what we should do about it."

That's the difference.
```

**ON-SCREEN ELEMENTS:**
- Highlight each framework part as typed (same color coding)
- Side-by-side comparison: "Generic analysis" vs "Framework analysis"
- Arrow pointing to table structure: "This is what actionable looks like"
- Quick stat graphic: "60% → 80% completion rate goal"

**EDITING NOTES:**
- Split screen is clear - both sides readable
- Zoom in on the table output
- Emphasize the word "actionable" with slight emphasis
- Pattern interrupt at 4:58: Quick music swell

---

### [5:00 - 6:30] EXAMPLE 3 - CONTENT CREATION

**VISUAL:** Full screen ChatGPT interface

**SCRIPT:**
```
Example number three: Creating content that actually sounds like you.

This one's for everyone who's tried to use AI for content and it came out sounding... robotic.

The problem: Most people just write:

[Type]
"Write a LinkedIn post about AI"

[Show boring, generic output]

[Read in monotone voice]
"Artificial intelligence is transforming the business landscape. Companies that embrace AI will have a competitive advantage. The future is here."

[Back to normal voice]

Yawn.

This is why people say AI content is easy to spot.

It's corporate speak. It's vague. It's boring.

But with the framework:

[Clear chat, type new prompt]

"Act as a thought leader in business innovation with a conversational, slightly provocative style.

Task: Write a LinkedIn post about how most companies are using AI wrong.

Context: I want to challenge the common approach of 'AI for everything' and argue for focused, practical AI adoption. My audience is mid-level managers and business owners who feel overwhelmed by AI hype.

Format: Hook in the first line, 3 short paragraphs (2-3 sentences each), end with a thought-provoking question. Use line breaks for readability.

Tone: Confident but not arrogant, conversational but professional, slightly contrarian."

[Hit enter, wait]

[Result appears]

Now we're talking.

[Read the hook aloud with energy]

"Hot take: Your company doesn't need an AI strategy. You need three good AI use cases."

[Back to normal voice]

This has a voice. A perspective. A point of view.

You could post this today.

Even better—you can edit it to match YOUR voice perfectly, because you started with something actually good.

Not "AI slop." Something with substance.

That's example three.
```

**ON-SCREEN ELEMENTS:**
- Side-by-side: Bland content vs. Framework content
- Highlight tone differences with color coding
- "Before: 😴 Boring" vs "After: 🔥 Engaging"
- Speech bubble pointing to good hook: "This grabs attention"

**EDITING NOTES:**
- Monotone reading of bad content for comedic effect (but subtle)
- Enthusiastic reading of good hook
- Quick cuts between bad and good examples
- Music picks up energy at 6:28
- Pattern interrupt: Energy shift in music

---

### [6:30 - 7:45] RECAP & FRAMEWORK BREAKDOWN

**VISUAL:** Return to talking head (now 40% of screen, picture-in-picture)
- Framework graphic appears next to talking head
- Clean, printable design

**SCRIPT:**
```
Okay, let's recap.

The 5-Part Prompt Framework.

[Point to each part as it appears]

Number 1: ROLE.
Who should ChatGPT act as? An expert? A specific profession? Give it an identity.

Not just "you're ChatGPT." Make it "you're a marketing strategist" or "you're a data analyst" or "you're a busy executive."

Number 2: TASK.
What exactly do you want? Be specific.

Not "write content." Say "write a 3-paragraph LinkedIn post" or "create a 5-item prioritized list."

Number 3: CONTEXT.
Why does this matter? What's the background?

The more context you give, the better the output. What's your goal? Who's your audience? What problem are you solving?

Number 4: FORMAT.
How should it be structured?

Bullet points? A table? An email? A social post? Be explicit about the format.

Number 5: TONE.
How should it sound?

Professional? Casual? Funny? Serious? Warm? Direct?

Give ChatGPT a vibe to match.

That's it.

Five parts.

Every time you use ChatGPT—or Claude, or Gemini, or any AI tool—think through these five things.

[Snap fingers or clap hands for emphasis]

I promise you, your outputs will go from "meh" to "whoa" immediately.

Now, here's the best part.
```

**Delivery Tips:**
- Smile (it shows in your voice)
- Use hand gestures (but keep them in frame)
- Make eye contact with camera during talking head sections

- If you mess up, just stop, take a breath, and start the sentence again

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Monotone delivery
- Reading directly from script (sounds robotic)
- Talking too fast (viewers need time to absorb)
