---

### [2:00-3:30] EXAMPLE 1: Business Email

**Bad way:**
- Type: "Write an email declining a meeting"
- Show generic result

**Good way (5-Part Framework):**
```
Act as a busy professional who values relationships.

Task: Write an email declining a meeting invitation.

Context: Meeting is with a vendor I want to maintain good relations with. I'm declining because our budget is frozen this quarter, but I want to leave the door open for Q2.

Format: Professional email, 3-4 sentences maximum.

Tone: Warm but direct, apologetic but not over-explaining.
```

- Show better result
- "See the difference? Human. Specific. Ready to use."

**PAUSE POINT:** "Try this yourself before continuing."

---

### [3:30-5:00] EXAMPLE 2: Data Analysis

**Scenario:** Have customer feedback, need to find patterns

**Bad way:**
- "Analyze this data"
- Show weak output

**Good way (Framework):**
```
Act as a customer insights analyst.

Task: Analyze this feedback to identify top 3 pain points and recommend 2 actionable solutions for each.

Context: This is onboarding feedback. We have 60% completion rate, want to increase to 80%. Limited technical resources.

Format: Table with columns: Pain Point, Impact, Recommended Solution. Then summary paragraph.

Tone: Data-driven but actionable, focus on quick wins.
```

- Paste sample data
- Show structured output with table
- "This is what your boss wants to see."

---

### [5:00-6:30] EXAMPLE 3: Content Creation

**Problem:** AI content sounds robotic

**Bad way:**
- "Write a LinkedIn post about AI"
- Show boring corporate-speak

**Good way (Framework):**
```
Act as a thought leader in business innovation with a conversational, slightly provocative style.

Task: Write a LinkedIn post about how most companies are using AI wrong.

Context: I want to challenge "AI for everything" approach and argue for focused, practical AI adoption. Audience is mid-level managers and business owners overwhelmed by AI hype.

Format: Hook in first line, 3 short paragraphs (2-3 sentences each), end with thought-provoking question. Use line breaks for readability.

Tone: Confident but not arrogant, conversational but professional, slightly contrarian.
```

- Show result with personality
- "Now you have a voice, a perspective."

## Editing Notes (Keep It Simple)

### DO:
- ✅ Cut all pauses over 2-3 seconds
- ✅ Remove major mistakes where you clearly restart
- ✅ Add 3-5 text overlays ("5-Part Framework", "Try it TODAY", etc.)
- ✅ Keep pacing tight

### DON'T:
- ❌ Obsess over every "um" or "uh" (natural is okay)
- ❌ Add fancy transitions (wastes time)
- ❌ Try to make it perfect (good enough > perfect)
- ❌ Re-record unless major issue (audio failure, wrong info)

---

## Thumbnail (10 minutes in Canva)

**Quick thumbnail formula:**
- Your face (confused → excited, or just excited)
- Large text: "10 Hours Saved"
- Smaller text: "5-Part AI Framework"
- ChatGPT logo or AI graphic
- High contrast colors

**Test 3 variations:**
1. "Save 10 Hours/Week"

3. "ChatGPT Secrets"

Pick the one that feels most authentic to you.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Trying to follow full script exactly** → Use outline, speak naturally
❌ **Stopping to re-record small mistakes** → Keep going, cut in edit
❌ **Over-editing** → 80% good is shippable
❌ **Waiting for perfect conditions** → Ship it, learn from feedback
❌ **Adding too many graphics** → 3-5 is enough for Tier 1

---

## After Publishing: Quick Feedback Loop

**Within 24 hours, check:**
- Retention graph (where do people drop off?)
- Comments (what questions come up?)
- Watch it yourself (what would you improve?)

**For Video 2, improve ONE thing:**
- Better hook?
- Clearer examples?
- Tighter editing?
- Better thumbnail?

**Don't try to fix everything at once. Systematic improvement.**

---

## When to Use Full Script Version

Use the full Tier 3 script (`session-1-full-script.md`) when:
- You've made 5-10 videos and are comfortable
- This video is for a paying client/course launch
- You want to create a "hero" version for main marketing
- You have 6-8 hours to invest in production

**For your FIRST video: Use this Tier 1 version. Ship fast.**

---

## Success = Shipping

**Remember:**
- Imperfect video published > Perfect video never made
- You'll learn more from shipping 3 "good enough" videos than perfecting 1
- Audience wants value, not perfection
- Your confidence grows with each video

**Goal: Publish within 1 week of reading this.**

**You've got this. Now go record.** 🎬
