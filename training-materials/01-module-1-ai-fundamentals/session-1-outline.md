## Video Structure with Precise Timing

### SECTION 1: HOOK (0:00 - 0:15) - 15 seconds
**Goal:** Stop the scroll, create curiosity, promise specific value

**Visual:**
- Screen showing before/after comparison
- "10 Hours/Week" text overlay
- Quick montage of 3 different AI outputs

**Script:**
```
Last month, I spent 45 minutes writing a client proposal.
This week? The same quality proposal in 4 minutes.
I'm going to show you the exact method I used—and you can try it in the next 10 minutes.
```

**On-screen text:**
- "45 min → 4 min"
- "Same quality, 11x faster"

**Pattern interrupt at 0:13:** Quick screen flash transition

---

### SECTION 2: VALUE PROMISE (0:15 - 0:45) - 30 seconds
**Goal:** Set expectations, establish credibility, relate to viewer pain

**Visual:**
- Switch to talking head (25% of screen)
- Bullet points appear on screen as mentioned

**Script:**
```
Here's what you'll learn in the next 10 minutes:

[Point 1 appears] The 5-part prompt framework that turns ChatGPT from "meh" to "wow"

[Point 2 appears] 3 real examples you can use TODAY—whether you're writing emails, analyzing data, or planning projects

[Point 3 appears] A free template with 25 ready-to-use prompts

And here's what you DON'T need: coding skills, expensive tools, or a PhD in AI.

Just 10 minutes and a free ChatGPT account.
```

**On-screen text:**
- ✅ "5-Part Prompt Framework"
- ✅ "3 Real Examples"
- ✅ "25 Free Templates"
- ❌ "NO coding required"
- ❌ "NO expensive tools"

**Pattern interrupt at 0:43:** Transition to screen recording

---

### SECTION 3: CONTEXT & SETUP (0:45 - 2:00) - 75 seconds
**Goal:** Establish the problem, create urgency, position the solution

**Visual:**
- 50/50 split: Bad prompt example on left, good prompt on right
- Highlight differences as explained

**Script:**
```
Here's the problem most people have with ChatGPT:

[Show bad prompt] They write something like: "Write me a business email"

[Show mediocre output] And they get something generic. Something that sounds like... well, AI.

So they think: "This isn't helpful. I could write better myself."

And they're right. But here's what they're missing:

[Pause for emphasis]

The difference between "AI is useless" and "AI just saved me 10 hours" comes down to one thing: how you ask.

Let me show you exactly what I mean.

[Transition to ChatGPT interface]

This is the 5-part prompt framework. It's stupid simple, but wildly effective.

[5 parts appear on screen as animated list]
1. Role
2. Task
3. Context
4. Format
5. Tone

Each part tells ChatGPT something it needs to give you exactly what you want.

Let me show you how it works with three real examples.
```

**On-screen graphics:**
- Bad prompt → Bad output (side by side)
- Good prompt → Good output (side by side)
- 5-Part Framework (animated reveal)

**Pattern interrupt at 1:58:** Music shift + screen zoom to ChatGPT interface

---

### SECTION 4: EXAMPLE 1 - Business Email (2:00 - 3:30) - 90 seconds
**Goal:** Demonstrate framework with relatable example, invite follow-along

**Visual:**
- Full screen: ChatGPT interface
- Type prompts in real-time (or appear to)
- Cursor movements visible

**Script:**
```
Example 1: Writing a business email.

Let's say you need to decline a meeting invitation professionally.

Here's how most people would prompt:
[Type slowly] "Write an email declining a meeting"

[Show result] Generic, awkward, doesn't sound like you.

Now watch what happens when we use the framework:

[Type the 5-part prompt]

"Act as a busy professional who values relationships.

Task: Write an email declining a meeting invitation.

Context: The meeting is with a vendor I want to maintain good relations with. I'm declining because our budget is frozen this quarter, but I want to leave the door open for future collaboration.

Format: Professional email, 3-4 sentences maximum.

Tone: Warm but direct, apologetic but not over-explaining."

[Hit enter, show result]

See the difference? This sounds human. It's specific. I could copy-paste this right now.

Let's try another one.
```

**On-screen annotations:**
- Highlight each of the 5 parts in different colors as they're mentioned
- Before/After comparison box in corner

**PAUSE POINT (3:25):**
```
Before we continue—pause the video and try this yourself. Open ChatGPT, use the framework, write a business email you actually need. I'll wait.

[3-second pause with on-screen text: "Go ahead, try it!"]

Okay, moving on.
```

**Pattern interrupt at 3:30:** Screen transition effect

---

### SECTION 5: EXAMPLE 2 - Data Analysis (3:30 - 5:00) - 90 seconds
**Goal:** Show framework works across different use cases

**Visual:**
- Split screen: Spreadsheet data on left, ChatGPT on right
- Data blurred for privacy but structure visible

**Script:**
```
Example 2: Analyzing data or making decisions.

Here's the scenario: You have customer feedback data and need to find patterns.

The lazy prompt: "Analyze this data"

[Show weak result]

The framework prompt:

[Type]
"Act as a customer insights analyst.

Task: Analyze this customer feedback to identify the top 3 pain points and recommend 2 actionable solutions for each.

Context: This is feedback from our onboarding process. We have a 60% completion rate and want to increase it to 80%. Our team has limited technical resources.

Format: Create a table with 3 columns: Pain Point, Impact (High/Medium/Low), Recommended Solution. Then a brief summary paragraph.

Tone: Data-driven but actionable, focus on quick wins."

[Paste sample data - can be mock data]

[Show result]

Look at this. It's not just "here are some insights"—it's structured, prioritized, and actionable.

This is the kind of output your boss or client actually wants to see.
```

**On-screen elements:**
- Sample data table (anonymized)
- Highlight the structure of the output
- "Lazy vs Framework" comparison

**Pattern interrupt at 4:58:** Quick transition sound

---

### SECTION 6: EXAMPLE 3 - Content Creation (5:00 - 6:30) - 90 seconds
**Goal:** Show creative application, appeal to freelancers/marketers

**Visual:**
- Full screen ChatGPT
- Show prompt + result for social media content

**Script:**
```
Example 3: Creating content that actually sounds like you.

This one's for everyone who's tried to use AI for content and it came out sounding... robotic.

The problem: "Write a LinkedIn post about AI"

[Show boring output]

Yawn. This is why people say AI content is easy to spot.

But with the framework:

[Type]
"Act as a thought leader in business innovation with a conversational, slightly provocative style.

Task: Write a LinkedIn post about how most companies are using AI wrong.

Context: I want to challenge the common approach of 'AI for everything' and argue for focused, practical AI adoption. My audience is mid-level managers and business owners who feel overwhelmed by AI hype.

Format: Hook in first line, 3 short paragraphs (2-3 sentences each), end with a thought-provoking question. Use line breaks for readability.

Tone: Confident but not arrogant, conversational but professional, slightly contrarian."

[Show result]

Now we're talking. This has a voice. A perspective. You could post this.

Even better—you can edit it to match YOUR voice perfectly, because you started with something actually good.
```

**On-screen elements:**
- Side-by-side of bland vs. good content
- Highlight tone differences
- "This → That" transformation visual

**Pattern interrupt at 6:28:** Music pickup, energy increase

---

### SECTION 7: RECAP & FRAMEWORK BREAKDOWN (6:30 - 7:45) - 75 seconds
**Goal:** Cement learning, make it repeatable, transition to action

**Visual:**
- Return to talking head (larger, 40% of screen)
- Framework graphic on screen

**Script:**
```
Okay, let's recap.

The 5-Part Prompt Framework:

[Each part appears/animates as mentioned]

1. ROLE - Who should ChatGPT act as? An expert? A specific profession? Give it identity.

2. TASK - What exactly do you want? Be specific. Not "write content" but "write a 3-paragraph LinkedIn post."

3. CONTEXT - Why does this matter? What's the background? The more context, the better the output.

4. FORMAT - How should it be structured? Bullet points? A table? An email? Define the format.

5. TONE - How should it sound? Professional? Casual? Funny? Serious? Set the vibe.

That's it. Five parts. Every time you use ChatGPT—or Claude, or any AI tool—think through these five things.

I promise you, your outputs will go from "meh" to "whoa" immediately.

Now here's the best part:
```

I'm going to challenge you to do something:

Pick ONE prompt from this library today—not tomorrow, TODAY—and try it.

Spend 5 minutes. See what you get.

I'm betting you'll save at least an hour this week. Probably more.

You already know how to do that.
