### [0:45-2:15] YOUR 3-TOOL STARTER STACK

**Tool 1: ChatGPT (OpenAI)**

- **Free version:** GPT-3.5 (surprisingly good for most tasks)
- **Paid ($20/month):** GPT-4 (better reasoning, fewer mistakes)
- **When to use:** 80% of your AI needs

**Tool 2: Claude (Anthropic)**
- **Use for:** Long documents, complex analysis, coding, nuanced tasks
- **Free version:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet (excellent, very capable)
- **Paid ($20/month):** Higher usage limits + Claude 3 Opus
- **When to use:** When ChatGPT gives shallow answers

**Tool 3: Perplexity or Google Gemini**
- **Use for:** Research with citations, current information, fact-checking
- **Free version:** Perplexity basic or Gemini 1.5
- **When to use:** Need sources, recent info, or fact verification

**Key Point:** Start with all free versions. Upgrade only when you hit limits.

### [2:15-3:45] CHATGPT VS CLAUDE VS GEMINI

**Decision Tree:**

**Use ChatGPT when:**
- ✅ Quick everyday tasks
- ✅ Creative writing, emails, social posts
- ✅ Explaining concepts simply
- ✅ Brainstorming and ideation
- ✅ You need a "default" AI tool

**Use Claude when:**
- ✅ Analyzing long documents (100+ pages)
- ✅ Complex reasoning or nuanced tasks
- ✅ Code review or programming help
- ✅ Tasks requiring careful, thoughtful responses
- ✅ When ChatGPT's answer feels shallow

**Use Perplexity/Gemini when:**
- ✅ Researching current events (after 2023)
- ✅ Need citations and sources
- ✅ Fact-checking other AI outputs
- ✅ Academic or research work
- ✅ Want to verify information

**Example:** "Write me a blog post about AI"
- ChatGPT: Quick draft, creative
- Claude: More thoughtful, structured
- Perplexity: With research citations

### [3:45-5:00] FREE VS PAID: WHEN TO UPGRADE

**Stay Free If:**
- ❌ You use AI less than 1 hour per day
- ❌ Free versions meet your needs
- ❌ You're still learning and experimenting
- ❌ Budget is tight

**Upgrade to Paid ($20/month) When:**
- ✅ You hit usage limits on free versions (rate limited)
- ✅ AI saves you 2+ hours per day (ROI: $20 vs. your hourly rate)
- ✅ You need GPT-4's better reasoning for work
- ✅ Free version quality isn't good enough for client work

**My Recommendation:**
- Month 1: All free versions
- Month 2: If using daily, upgrade ONE tool (usually ChatGPT)
- Month 3: Add second paid tool if needed (usually Claude)

**ROI Calculation:**
- If you earn $50/hour and AI saves 2 hours/week = $100/week saved
- $20/month cost = Break even in 1 week
- Rest of month = Pure profit

---

### [5:00-6:15] TOOLS YOU DON'T NEED (YET)

**Skip These for Now:**

**Specialized AI Writers:**
- Jasper, Copy.ai, Writesonic
- Why skip: ChatGPT + Claude do the same thing
- Save: $50-100/month

**AI Image Generators:**
- Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion
- Why skip: Unless image creation is your core need
- Use free alternatives first: Bing Image Creator

**AI Video Tools:**
- Synthesia, D-ID, Runway
- Why skip: Expensive, niche use cases
- Wait until: You have specific video needs

**AI Coding Assistants:**
- GitHub Copilot, Cursor
- Why skip: Unless you code daily
- Alternative: Claude or ChatGPT for occasional coding

**AI Meeting Assistants:**
- Otter.ai, Fireflies, Grain
- Why skip: ChatGPT can summarize transcripts
- Upgrade later: When meetings are daily

**Enterprise AI:**
- Custom deployments, private instances
- Why skip: $10,000+ per year, overkill for small teams
- Wait until: 50+ employees using AI

**The Pattern:** Start simple, add complexity only when free/basic tools limit you.
