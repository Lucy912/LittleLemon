## Key Insights for Session 1 Script

### What to INCLUDE:
✅ One specific, impressive demo (not 5 mediocre ones)
✅ Actual numbers (hours, dollars, percentages)
✅ "Person like you" testimonial
✅ Visual proof (before/after, screen recording)
✅ Free downloadable resource
✅ Clear, single next step

### What to EXCLUDE:
❌ Technical jargon without explanation
❌ Multiple tool comparisons (creates overwhelm)
❌ Long history of AI development
❌ "Here's everything you could do" (too broad)
❌ Selling in the first video (build trust first)

### Critical Success Factors:
1. **Specificity beats generality** - "Save 10 hours" not "save time"
2. **Show don't tell** - Live demo beats explaining
3. **Relatable not impressive** - Normal person beats genius
4. **One clear takeaway** - Depth over breadth
5. **Easy first step** - Lower barrier to action

## Session 1 Content Decision

**Based on this analysis, Session 1 should:**

**Title:** "What AI Can Actually Do for You: Save 10 Hours This Week"

**Core Content:**
- 1 powerful ChatGPT prompt technique that works across all roles
- Live demonstration with 3 different use cases (covers all segments)
- Downloadable: Prompt template library (25 prompts)

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Everyone uses ChatGPT (familiar starting point)
- ✅ Prompts work for all three audiences (B2B/job seeker/freelancer)
- ✅ Can show value in 10 minutes
- ✅ Zero cost to try (removes friction)
- ✅ Immediate applicability
- ✅ Natural lead-in to Session 2 (advanced prompting)

**Alternative approaches considered:**
- ❌ "AI Tools Overview" - Too broad, creates overwhelm
- ❌ "n8n Automation" - Too advanced for Session 1, scares beginners
- ❌ "AI Ethics" - Important but not engaging for first video
