## Video Outline (Talking Points)

### [0:00-0:15] HOOK
"AI will confidently lie to you. It will make up facts, cite non-existent sources, and reinforce your biases. Here's how to catch it before it embarrasses you."

**Visual:** AI confidently presenting false information (fake citations, made-up statistics)

---

### [0:15-0:45] WHY AI GETS THINGS WRONG

**The reality check:**

**1. AI doesn't "know" things**
- It predicts likely word sequences
- No fact database, no truth detector
- "Sounds right" ≠ "Is right"

**2. AI "hallucinates"** (makes things up)
- Invents sources that don't exist
- Creates plausible-sounding fake data
- Fabricates quotes, studies, statistics
- Confidence level ≠ accuracy

**3. AI has biases from training data**
- Reflects biases in internet text (skews Western, English, male perspectives)
- Outdated information (knowledge cutoff dates)
- Overrepresents certain viewpoints
- Missing diverse perspectives

**The problem:** AI output sounds so confident and professional that we trust it without verifying.

**Real incidents:**
- Lawyers citing fake court cases → sanctioned
- Journalists using fabricated quotes → reputation destroyed
- Businesses basing decisions on hallucinated data → costly mistakes

**This video teaches you to trust but verify.**

---

### [0:45-2:00] THE 5 TYPES OF AI ERRORS

**Error Type 1: Hallucination (Pure Fiction)**

**What it is:** AI invents information that doesn't exist.

**Examples:**
- Citing research papers that were never published
- Creating fake statistics
- Inventing product features
- Making up historical events

**Red flags:**
- Very specific citations without URLs
- Statistics without sources
- "According to a study..." (which study?)
- Perfect answer to obscure question

**How to catch it:** Ask for sources, Google the claims, verify citations actually exist.

---

**Error Type 2: Outdated Information**

**What it is:** AI's training data has a cutoff date (often 1-2 years ago).

**Examples:**
- Current events it doesn't know about
- New laws, regulations, standards
- Recent research findings
- Company acquisitions, leadership changes
- Technology updates

**Red flags:**
- Information about "current" events
- Statements like "as of 2023" (when it's 2025)
- Missing recent developments

**How to catch it:** Check dates, verify with recent sources, use web search for current info.

---

**Error Type 3: Cultural & Demographic Bias**

**What it is:** AI reflects biases from its training data.

**Examples:**
- Defaulting to Western perspectives
- Assuming English-language contexts
- Gender stereotypes in career suggestions
- Geographic bias (overrepresenting US)
- Socioeconomic assumptions

**Red flags:**
- Generic advice that doesn't fit your context
- Assumptions about your audience/market
- One-size-fits-all recommendations

**How to catch it:** Question assumptions, specify your context, seek diverse perspectives.

---

**Error Type 4: Logical Inconsistencies**

**What it is:** AI contradicts itself or makes illogical leaps.

**Examples:**
- Contradicting statements in same response
- Faulty reasoning in step-by-step analysis
- Mixing up cause and effect
- Cherry-picking data to fit conclusion

**Red flags:**
- Conclusion doesn't follow from premises
- Different parts of response conflict
- Oversimplified complex issues

**How to catch it:** Read critically, check logic, ask AI to explain reasoning.

---

**Error Type 5: Overconfidence on Uncertainty**

**What it is:** AI presents uncertain information as fact.

**Examples:**
- Predictions stated as certainties
- "This will definitely..." (nothing is definite)
- Ignoring nuance and complexity
- Single "right answer" to complex question

**Red flags:**
- Absolute language ("always," "never," "definitely")
- No caveats or limitations mentioned
- Oversimplified answers to complex questions

**How to catch it:** Ask for limitations, alternative viewpoints, and sources of uncertainty.

---

### [2:00-3:30] THE VERIFICATION PROCESS (4-Step Method)

**When should you verify AI outputs?**

**Always verify when:**
- ✅ Facts will be shared publicly (posts, articles, presentations)
- ✅ Decisions have significant consequences (business strategy, legal, financial)
- ✅ Information seems too convenient or perfect
- ✅ You're in a regulated industry (healthcare, finance, legal)
- ✅ Data includes numbers, statistics, research citations

**Can skip verification when:**
- 💭 Brainstorming ideas (not final outputs)
- 💭 Creative writing (fiction, marketing concepts)
- 💭 Personal use with no external impact
- 💭 You have direct expertise to judge accuracy immediately

---

**THE 4-STEP VERIFICATION METHOD:**

**Step 1: Source Check**

Ask AI for sources:
"Where did this information come from? Provide sources."

Then verify those sources:
- Do the sources actually exist? (Google them)
- Do they actually say what AI claims? (Read them)
- Are sources credible? (Check author credentials, publication reputation)
- Are sources recent? (Check publication dates)

**Example:**
```
AI: "Studies show 85% of companies use AI."
You: "What studies? Provide specific sources."
AI: "According to McKinsey's 2023 AI report..."
You: [Google "McKinsey 2023 AI report" to verify it exists and contains that stat]
```

---

**Step 2: Cross-Reference Check**

Don't trust a single source (including AI):
- Search the claim on Google
- Check 2-3 independent authoritative sources
- Look for consensus vs. outlier claims
- Check official sources (company websites, government sites, academic institutions)

**Example:**
```
AI says: "The GDPR fine limit is €20M or 4% of revenue"
You verify:
- Official GDPR website (europa.eu)
- Legal firm summaries
- Recent enforcement examples
✓ Confirmed across multiple authoritative sources
```

---

**Step 3: Logic Check**

Read critically:
- Does the reasoning make sense?
- Does the conclusion follow from the premises?
- Are there obvious contradictions?
- What's missing from the analysis?
- What assumptions are built in?

**Example:**
```
AI: "Your sales will increase 50% if you double marketing spend."
Logic check:
- Assumes linear relationship (rarely true)
- Ignores market saturation
- No data supporting this specific claim
- Oversimplified
→ Don't trust this number without deeper analysis
```

---

**Step 4: Expert Review (for high-stakes decisions)**

Have a human expert review:
- Legal content → lawyer reviews
- Medical content → doctor reviews
- Financial content → accountant/CFO reviews
- Technical content → engineer reviews

AI is a draft generator, not a replacement for expertise.

**When expert review is essential:**
- Legal contracts, compliance documents
- Medical advice, treatment plans
- Financial projections, tax filings
- Safety-critical systems
- Public-facing official communications

---

### [3:30-4:45] HOW TO PROMPT FOR ACCURACY

**You can improve AI accuracy with better prompting.**

**Technique 1: Ask for sources proactively**

❌ Basic: "What's the market size for AI training?"
✅ Better: "What's the market size for AI training in Europe? Provide specific sources with URLs, publication dates, and brief methodology notes."

**Result:** AI is more likely to give real sources when explicitly asked.

---

**Technique 2: Request multiple perspectives**

❌ Basic: "Should we expand to Germany?"
✅ Better: "Should we expand to Germany? Give me 3 perspectives: optimistic case, pessimistic case, and realistic middle ground. State assumptions for each."

**Result:** Reduces overconfidence, exposes assumptions.

---

**Technique 3: Ask AI to identify its limitations**

Add to your prompts:
"What don't you know about this? What assumptions are you making? What would change your recommendation?"

**Example:**
```
Prompt: "Analyze this market opportunity.

Include:
1. Your analysis
2. What information you DON'T have that would improve this analysis
3. What assumptions you're making
4. What data would change your recommendation"
```

**Result:** AI becomes more honest about uncertainty.

---

**Technique 4: Request fact-checking guidance**

❌ Basic: "Write a blog post about GDPR."
✅ Better: "Write a blog post about GDPR. For any facts, statistics, or legal requirements mentioned, provide [SOURCE] tags with specific citations I should verify before publishing."

**Result:** Clear flagging of what needs verification.

---

**Technique 5: Use AI to fact-check AI**

**Two-AI method:**
1. Get answer from AI #1
2. Ask AI #2: "Fact-check this. What claims need verification? What sources should I check?"

**Different models have different training:**
- ChatGPT vs Claude vs Gemini
- Cross-reference between them
- Where they disagree → verify more carefully

**Example:**
```
ChatGPT gives you analysis → Copy to Claude →
"Fact-check the claims in this text. Identify any statistics, sources, or facts that should be verified. Flag any potential hallucinations."
```

---

### [4:45-5:45] BIAS AWARENESS & MITIGATION

**How to recognize bias in AI outputs:**

**🚩 Bias Red Flag 1: Homogeneous Perspectives**
- All examples from one geographic region
- All personas in one demographic
- Single cultural viewpoint presented as universal

**Fix:** "Provide examples from diverse geographic regions / cultures / demographics."

---

**🚩 Bias Red Flag 2: Stereotypical Assumptions**
- Career suggestions based on gender
- Leadership traits defaulting to masculine
- Family structures assumed to be traditional

**Fix:** "Avoid gender assumptions. Present diverse perspectives."

---

**🚩 Bias Red Flag 3: Economic/Class Assumptions**
- Assuming access to resources (tech, money, time)
- Solutions requiring significant capital
- Ignoring cost barriers

**Fix:** "Consider constraints: limited budget, small team, minimal resources."

---

**🚩 Bias Red Flag 4: Western/English-Centric**
- US labor laws assumed universal
- English-language sources only
- Western business practices as default

**Fix:** "Focus on [your specific region]. Consider [your local regulations, culture, market]."

---

**🚩 Bias Red Flag 5: Recency Bias**
- Latest trends presented as permanent
- Historical context missing
- "Revolutionary" claims without nuance

**Fix:** "Provide historical context. What are the limitations of current approaches?"

---

**The de-biasing prompt template:**
```
[Your main prompt]

Additionally:
- Consider diverse perspectives (geographic, cultural, demographic)
- Avoid stereotypical assumptions
- Acknowledge limitations and uncertainty
- Provide historical context, not just current trends
- Flag any biases in your analysis
```

---

### [5:45-6:30] COMMON FACT-CHECKING SCENARIOS

**Scenario 1: AI cites a "study"**

Your process:
1. Ask for full citation (authors, year, journal, title)
2. Google the exact title
3. Verify it exists on credible site (PubMed, Google Scholar, journal site)
4. Read abstract to confirm claim
5. Check if study has been criticized/retracted

**Time: 2-3 minutes**

---

**Scenario 2: AI gives you statistics**

Your process:
1. Ask: "What's the source of this statistic?"
2. Google: "[statistic] + [topic] + source"
3. Find original report/study
4. Check: Sample size, methodology, date, who funded it
5. Verify number hasn't been misinterpreted

**Time: 3-5 minutes**

---

**Scenario 3: AI provides legal/regulatory information**

Your process:
1. Check official government/regulatory website
2. Verify effective dates (laws change)
3. Check jurisdiction (laws vary by location)
4. For anything important: consult actual lawyer
5. Never rely solely on AI for legal advice

**Time: 5-10 minutes (or lawyer consult for high-stakes)**

---

Your process:
1. Check official documentation (product docs, API docs)
2. Verify version numbers (tech changes fast)
3. Test if possible (don't assume, verify)
4. Check community forums for real user experiences
5. Look for recent updates/changes

**Time: 5-10 minutes**

---

**Scenario 5: AI provides business/market data**

Your process:
1. Ask for sources
2. Cross-reference with: Gartner, Forrester, McKinsey, CB Insights (depending on topic)
3. Check publication date (market data ages quickly)
4. Look for conflicting estimates (different methodologies)
5. Use most conservative number or range

**Time: 10-15 minutes**

---
