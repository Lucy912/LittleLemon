## Video Outline (Talking Points)

### [0:00-0:15] HOOK
"Before we go further, we need to talk about what could get you fired, sued, or fined. Here's what you absolutely must never put in AI."

**Visual:** Red warning symbols with examples of sensitive data types

---

### [0:15-0:45] WHY THIS MATTERS (Stakes)

**The reality:**
- ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini are NOT private vaults
- Your data trains their models (some exceptions apply)
- Data breaches happen (Samsung, JP Morgan incidents)
- GDPR fines reach €20M or 4% of global revenue
- One leak can end careers, damage companies, violate laws

**Recent real incidents:**
- **Samsung (2023):** Engineers pasted proprietary code into ChatGPT → source code leaked
- **Law firms:** Lawyers cited fake cases generated by AI → sanctions, reputation damage
- **Healthcare:** Patient data accidentally shared → HIPAA violations, lawsuits

**This isn't theoretical. This is happening right now.**

**Good news:** Easy to avoid if you know the rules.

---

### [0:45-2:00] THE NEVER LIST (5 Categories)

**NEVER put these 5 things in AI:**

**1. Personal Identifiable Information (PII)**
❌ Names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses
❌ Social security numbers, passport numbers, ID numbers
❌ Dates of birth, medical records, financial information
❌ Photos of people, biometric data
❌ Customer lists with contact details

**Why:** GDPR, CCPA, and privacy laws prohibit sharing without consent.
**Example violation:** "Draft email to john.smith@company.com about his performance issues" → You just shared employee PII.

**2. Proprietary & Confidential Information**
❌ Source code, algorithms, trade secrets
❌ Unreleased product plans, pricing strategies
❌ Financial data (before public disclosure)
❌ Customer contracts, NDAs, legal agreements
❌ Internal processes that create competitive advantage

**Why:** Competitors could access it, NDA violations, loss of competitive edge.
**Example violation:** "Review this code for our authentication system" → You exposed security architecture.

**3. Credentials & Access Information**
❌ Passwords, API keys, tokens
❌ Database connection strings
❌ SSH keys, certificates
❌ Login credentials of any kind
❌ Security questions/answers

**Why:** Direct path to breach, immediate security risk.
**Example violation:** "Help me debug this code [pastes API key]" → Your API key is now compromised.

**4. Sensitive Business Data**
❌ Pending deals, M&A information
❌ Unannounced layoffs, reorgs
❌ Legal disputes, investigations
❌ Salary information, compensation data
❌ Performance reviews with names

**Why:** Insider trading implications, employee relations, legal liability.
**Example violation:** "Draft communication about upcoming 20% layoff" → Leak risk destroys trust, legal issues.

**5. Anything You Don't Have Rights To Share**
❌ Client data (unless approved in contract)
❌ Partner information under NDA
❌ Third-party copyrighted material
❌ Data from other companies
❌ Personal data of colleagues without consent

**Why:** Contract violations, copyright infringement, trust destruction.
**Example violation:** "Analyze this customer data from ClientCo" → NDA violation, contract breach.

---

### [2:00-3:15] THE ANONYMIZATION STRATEGY

**You CAN use AI for sensitive topics IF you anonymize properly.**

**The 3-step anonymization process:**

**Step 1: Remove all identifiers**
- Replace names with: Company A, Person 1, Client X
- Remove locations: "A major European city" not "Amsterdam"
- Remove dates: "Q4" not "November 15"
- Remove specific numbers: "~€50K" not "€47,326"
- Remove unique details that could identify

**Step 2: Generalize context**
- "A B2B SaaS company" not "A project management tool"
- "A team member" not "Senior engineer on payments team"
- "A client in finance" not "Deutsche Bank"

**Step 3: Test the anonymization**
- Ask: Could someone identify the person/company from this?
- If yes → anonymize more
- If no → safe to proceed

**EXAMPLE: Performance Review Feedback**

❌ **WRONG (Identifiable):**
"Help me write a performance review for Sarah Johnson, senior developer on the payments team at Amsterdam office. She's been late to meetings and her last 3 PRs had bugs..."

✅ **RIGHT (Anonymized):**
"Help me write a performance review for a senior developer. Areas to address: Punctuality in team meetings could improve, recent code submissions needed additional review cycles. How do I frame this constructively while being clear about expectations?"

**What changed:**
- Name removed
- Specific role/team generalized
- Location removed
- Context preserved (feedback still useful)
- No way to identify the actual person

**You got the help you needed without compromising privacy.**

---

### [3:15-4:30] SAFE ALTERNATIVES (What TO Do Instead)

**"But I need help with sensitive work. What do I do?"**

**Here are 5 safe alternatives:**

**Alternative 1: Use Enterprise AI with data controls**
- ChatGPT Enterprise (data not used for training)
- Claude Enterprise (data privacy guarantees)
- Azure OpenAI (your private instance)
- Google Vertex AI (controlled environment)
- **Cost:** Higher, but protects sensitive data
- **When:** Your company handles regulated data

**Alternative 2: Local/On-Premise AI**
- Self-hosted LLMs (Llama, Mistral on your servers)
- No data leaves your infrastructure
- **Cost:** Technical setup required
- **When:** Maximum security needed (healthcare, finance, defense)

**Alternative 3: Anonymization (as shown above)**
- Remove PII, keep structure
- Generalize specifics
- **Cost:** Free, just takes thought
- **When:** Need help with process/structure, not specific data

**Alternative 4: Work with templates/examples, not real data**
- Use fictional examples
- "Here's a template customer contract..." (made up)
- Get the framework, apply to real data separately
- **Cost:** Free
- **When:** Learning how to do something new

**Alternative 5: Don't use AI for this task**
- Some things shouldn't involve AI
- Consult lawyer, not AI, for legal questions
- Consult security expert, not AI, for security architecture
- Consult doctor, not AI, for medical decisions
- **When:** Stakes are too high, expertise required

**Decision framework:**
```
Is the data sensitive?
  → YES: Is it anonymizable?
      → YES: Anonymize and proceed
      → NO: Don't use public AI
  → NO: Proceed with public AI
```

### [4:30-5:30] COMMON MISTAKES & HOW TO CATCH THEM

**Mistake 1: "I'll just use it once"**
❌ Thinking: One time won't matter
✅ Reality: That's when leaks happen
🛡️ Fix: Treat every prompt as potentially public

**Mistake 2: "My data isn't that interesting"**
❌ Thinking: No one cares about my work
✅ Reality: Aggregated data is valuable, regulators don't care if it's "interesting"
🛡️ Fix: Follow rules regardless of perceived importance

**Mistake 3: "I trust this AI company"**
❌ Thinking: Big tech companies are secure
✅ Reality: Even best companies have breaches (see: every major breach ever)
🛡️ Fix: Trust, but verify. Follow security protocols.

**Mistake 4: "I'll be careful"**
❌ Thinking: I'll remember what's sensitive
✅ Reality: Under deadline pressure, mistakes happen
🛡️ Fix: Use a checklist before every prompt (deliverable below)

**Mistake 5: "My company doesn't have a policy yet"**
❌ Thinking: No policy means no rules
✅ Reality: Laws still apply, common sense still applies
🛡️ Fix: Follow this checklist until official policy exists

**The pre-prompt checklist (memorize this):**

Before hitting "Send" on any AI prompt, ask:
1. ☐ Does this contain anyone's name? → Remove or anonymize
2. ☐ Could this identify a specific person/company? → Generalize
3. ☐ Would I be comfortable if this appeared on the front page of a newspaper? → If no, don't send
4. ☐ Is this under NDA or confidential? → Don't send or use enterprise AI
5. ☐ Does this contain passwords, keys, or credentials? → Remove

**If you answered YES to questions 1-5, you need to edit or not send.**

---

### [5:30-6:15] YOUR COMPANY'S AI POLICY

**Does your company have an AI policy?**

**If YES:**
- Read it (seriously, actually read it)
- Follow it (even if it feels restrictive)
- Ask questions if unclear
- Suggest improvements if outdated

**If NO:**
- Follow this checklist until they create one
- Consider proposing a policy (Video 3.3 will help)
- Document your safe usage practices
- Be the responsible example

**What a good AI policy includes:**
1. What tools are approved (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
2. What data can/cannot be shared
3. How to anonymize data
4. When to use enterprise vs free tools
5. Who to ask when unsure
6. What happens if you violate the policy

**If you're in a regulated industry (healthcare, finance, legal):**
- Policies are often stricter
- Enterprise/local AI is usually required
- Compliance teams should be involved
- When in doubt, ask before using

---

### [6:15-7:00] CHALLENGE & WRAP

**Your challenge:**

**Step 1: Audit your last 10 AI prompts**
- Go through your ChatGPT/Claude history
- Check: Did I share anything from the NEVER list?
- If yes: Delete those conversations, change exposed credentials
- Learn what mistakes you're prone to

**Step 2: Make the pre-prompt checklist a habit**
- Print the checklist (in deliverable below)
- Put it next to your computer
- Check it before every prompt this week
- It will become automatic

**Step 3: Share with your team**
- Most people don't know these risks
- Share this video or the security checklist
- Prevent disasters before they happen
- Build a culture of responsible AI use

ANONYMIZATION GUIDE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

You CAN get help with sensitive topics IF anonymized properly.

✅ THE 3-STEP PROCESS:

STEP 1: Remove all identifiers
• Names → "Person A", "Company X", "Client 1"
• Locations → "A major city", "Northern Europe"
• Dates → "Q3", "Last month" (not specific dates)
• Numbers → "~€50K", "Mid-six figures" (approximate)
• Unique details → Generalize anything distinctive

STEP 2: Generalize context
• "A B2B SaaS company" not "Salesforce competitor"
• "A team member" not "Senior engineer on Platform team"
• "A client in finance" not "A global investment bank"
• Keep just enough context for useful advice

STEP 3: Test the anonymization
• Ask: Could someone identify the person/company?
• If YES → anonymize more
• If NO → safe to proceed

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
EXAMPLE: Before & After
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
