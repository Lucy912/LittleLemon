## Video Outline (Talking Points)

### [0:00-0:15] HOOK
"Whether you're a solo freelancer or part of a 1,000-person company, you need an AI policy. Here's how to create one in 30 minutes that actually gets used."

**Visual:** Policy document transforming from complex legal jargon to simple, clear guidelines

---

### [0:15-0:45] WHY YOU NEED AN AI POLICY

**The reality:**

**Without a policy:**
- Team members unsure what's allowed

- Legal/compliance exposure

**With a clear policy:**
- Everyone knows the rules
- Consistent, safe practices
- Reduced risk of data leaks
- Legal protection (showing due diligence)
- Faster AI adoption (clarity removes fear)

**Who needs a policy:**
- ✅ Companies of any size (even 2-person startups)
- ✅ Freelancers working with client data
- ✅ Teams in regulated industries
- ✅ Anyone handling sensitive information
- ✅ Organizations that want to move fast safely

**Good news:** You don't need lawyers or compliance teams. You need clear, practical guidelines that fit on 2-3 pages.

### [0:45-2:15] THE 8 ESSENTIAL POLICY COMPONENTS

**A good AI policy answers 8 questions:**

**1. WHICH TOOLS ARE APPROVED?**

What it covers:
- Specific AI tools allowed (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- Free vs paid tiers
- Personal accounts vs company accounts
- Enterprise tools for sensitive data
- Tools that are NOT allowed (and why)

**Why it matters:** Prevents team from using risky, unapproved tools.

**Example policy language:**
```
APPROVED TOOLS:
• ChatGPT Plus/Enterprise (company accounts only)
• Claude Pro (company accounts only)
• Gemini Advanced (approved for non-sensitive work)

FREE TIERS:
• Allowed for brainstorming, learning, non-sensitive work only
• NOT allowed for client data, proprietary info, confidential work

ENTERPRISE TOOLS (for sensitive data):
• ChatGPT Enterprise (procurement in progress)
• Required for: client contracts, financial data, proprietary code

PROHIBITED TOOLS:
• Browser extensions that inject AI (security risk)
• Unknown/unvetted AI tools
• AI tools from untrusted sources
```

---

**2. WHAT DATA CAN/CANNOT BE SHARED?**

What it covers:
- The NEVER list (from Video 3.1)
- How to anonymize data properly
- Examples specific to your industry
- Consequences of violations

**Why it matters:** Prevents data leaks and compliance violations.

**Example policy language:**
```
NEVER SHARE IN AI:
✗ Customer PII (names, emails, addresses, IDs)
✗ Proprietary code, trade secrets, unreleased products
✗ Credentials (passwords, API keys, tokens)
✗ Financial data, salaries, sensitive business information
✗ Anything under NDA or client contracts

ANONYMIZATION REQUIRED:
✓ Remove all names (use "Client A", "Person 1")
✓ Generalize locations, dates, specific numbers
✓ Test: Could someone identify the person/company? If yes, anonymize more

If unsure whether data is sensitive: ask [Security Team / Manager] first.
```

---

**3. WHEN IS AI USE REQUIRED VS OPTIONAL?**

What it covers:
- Tasks where AI accelerates work (encouraged)
- Tasks where human judgment is required (AI assists only)
- Tasks where AI is prohibited (critical decisions)

**Why it matters:** Sets clear expectations, prevents over-reliance.

**Example policy language:**
```
ENCOURAGED AI USE:
• First drafts (emails, documents, code)
• Research and summarization
• Brainstorming and ideation
• Data analysis assistance
• Meeting notes and summaries

AI ASSISTS, HUMAN DECIDES:
• Strategy and planning (AI provides options, human chooses)
• Performance reviews (AI helps structure, human personalizes)
• Customer communication (AI drafts, human edits)
• Code review (AI catches issues, human approves)

AI PROHIBITED:
• Final legal advice (consult lawyer)
• Medical decisions (consult doctor)
• Financial audits (human accountant required)
• Hiring decisions (AI can screen, human decides)
• Disciplinary actions (human only)
```

---

**4. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR AI OUTPUTS?**

What it covers:
- Accountability (you, not AI)
- Review requirements before publishing
- Fact-checking expectations
- Quality standards

**Why it matters:** Prevents "AI told me to" excuses, ensures quality.

**Example policy language:**
```
ACCOUNTABILITY:
• You are responsible for all AI outputs you use or publish
• "AI generated this" is not an excuse for errors, violations, or poor quality
• Review and edit all AI content before using

BEFORE PUBLISHING/SHARING AI CONTENT:
□ Fact-check all claims (use Video 3.2 verification process)
□ Remove or verify statistics and citations
□ Ensure tone and quality meet our standards
□ Add "AI-assisted" disclosure where appropriate

QUALITY STANDARD:
• AI outputs are drafts, not finals
• Apply your expertise and judgment
• If you wouldn't put your name on it, don't use it
```

---

**5. HOW TO USE AI ETHICALLY & RESPONSIBLY?**

What it covers:
- Bias awareness
- Fact-checking requirements
- Transparency (when to disclose AI use)
- Respect for IP and copyright

**Why it matters:** Builds trust, avoids legal issues, maintains reputation.

**Example policy language:**
```
ETHICAL GUIDELINES:
• Check for bias (use Video 3.2 bias checklist)
• Don't present AI output as human-created when context matters
• Respect copyright (don't train AI on others' copyrighted work without permission)
• Consider impact on stakeholders (employees, customers, partners)

TRANSPARENCY:
• Disclose AI use when:
  - Content is public-facing and substantial
  - Audience has right to know (e.g., AI-generated customer service)
  - It affects trust or decision-making
• Disclosure examples:
  - "This article was drafted with AI assistance and reviewed by [Name]"
  - "AI helped analyze this data; conclusions are ours"
```

---

**6. WHAT TRAINING IS REQUIRED?**

What it covers:
- Mandatory training for all team members
- Role-specific training
- How to stay updated
- Resources available

**Why it matters:** Policy is useless if people don't understand it.

**Example policy language:**
```
REQUIRED TRAINING:
• All employees: Complete AI Safety & Best Practices course (this training!)
• New hires: Complete within first 2 weeks
• Annual refresher: Required for all team members
• Role-specific training: Available for marketing, sales, product, etc.

RESOURCES:

```

---

**7. WHAT HAPPENS IF POLICY IS VIOLATED?**

What it covers:
- How to report violations or concerns
- Consequences (progressive discipline)
- How to fix mistakes
- Culture of learning vs punishment

**Why it matters:** Clear consequences create accountability; reporting process catches issues early.

**Example policy language:**
```
IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE:
1. Report immediately to [Manager / Security Team]
2. Document what happened
3. Take corrective action (delete conversation, change credentials, etc.)
4. Learn and improve (mistakes happen, honesty matters)

IF YOU SEE A VIOLATION:
• Report to [Manager / Security / Ethics Hotline]
• We value catching issues before they cause harm

CONSEQUENCES:
• First incident (unintentional): Coaching and retraining
• Repeat violations: Written warning
• Serious violations (intentional data breach, ignoring warnings): Up to termination
• We aim to educate, not punish. But patterns matter.
```

---

**8. HOW WILL THIS POLICY BE UPDATED?**

What it covers:
- Who owns the policy
- How often it's reviewed
- How to suggest improvements
- How changes are communicated

**Why it matters:** AI evolves fast; policy must keep pace.

**Example policy language:**
```
POLICY OWNERSHIP:
• Owner: [IT Director / Head of Operations / AI Champion]
• Review cycle: Quarterly (or as needed)
• Last updated: [Date]
• Version: 1.0

UPDATES:

### [2:15-3:45] HOW TO CREATE YOUR POLICY (The 30-Minute Method)

**You can create a first draft in 30 minutes using this process:**

**Step 1: Use the template (5 minutes)**
- Download the AI Policy Template (deliverable)
- It has all 8 components with example language
- Customize the [brackets] with your specifics

**Step 2: Adapt to your context (15 minutes)**

Answer these questions:
- **Industry:** Regulated (healthcare, finance, legal) or not?
  - If regulated → stricter rules, enterprise tools required
  - If not → more flexibility, focus on common sense

- **Company size:** Solo, startup (2-20), or larger (20+)?
  - Solo/small → simpler policy, focus on safe practices
  - Larger → more formal, include approval processes

- **Data sensitivity:** Do you handle PII, financial data, health data?
  - If yes → strict data sharing rules, anonymization required
  - If no → focus on IP protection, quality standards

- **Current AI maturity:** Are people already using AI, or is this new?
  - Already using → policy formalizes current best practices
  - New to AI → policy includes more education, gradual rollout

**Step 3: Make it practical (10 minutes)**

Test the policy:
- Read it out loud. Does it sound like normal communication or legal jargon?
- Can you explain each rule in one sentence?
- Are there specific examples people can follow?
- Is it short enough that people will actually read it?

**Goal:** 2-3 pages max. If longer, it won't get used.

---

### [3:45-5:00] POLICY ROLLOUT STRATEGY

**Creating the policy is step 1. Getting people to follow it is step 2.**

**The 4-phase rollout:**

**Phase 1: Leadership Buy-In (Week 1)**
- Share draft with leadership/key stakeholders
- Get feedback and approval
- Secure resources for training
- Identify policy owner (someone accessible)

**Questions to address:**
- What tools will we pay for? (ChatGPT Plus, Enterprise?)
- Who approves exceptions?
- What's the enforcement approach? (education-first vs punitive)

---

**Phase 2: Pilot Test (Week 2)**
- Share with 3-5 team members for feedback
- Have them try to follow it for one week
- Questions to ask:
  - What's unclear?
  - What's missing?
  - What's too restrictive?
  - Would you actually follow this?
- Revise based on feedback

---

**Phase 3: Training & Launch (Week 3)**
- Announce policy company-wide
- Run training session (use this video series!)
- Provide checklists and resources
- Make policy easily accessible (intranet, shared drive, printed copies)

**Communication tips:**
- Lead with "why" (protect team, enable faster work, reduce risk)
- Emphasize support, not restriction
- Share success stories (how AI is helping team)
- Make it easy to ask questions

---

**Phase 4: Monitor & Iterate (Ongoing)**
- Check-in after 30 days: How's it going?
- Gather feedback: What's working? What's not?
- Update policy based on learnings
- Share wins: "Thanks to our policy, we avoided [issue]"

**Metrics to track:**
- How many people completed training?
- Any incidents or violations?
- How often is policy referenced/used?
- Are people asking questions? (good sign of engagement)

---

### [5:00-6:00] COMMON POLICY MISTAKES & HOW TO AVOID THEM

**Mistake 1: Too Restrictive (Fear-Based)**
❌ "AI is banned except with manager approval for each use"
✅ "AI is encouraged for [these tasks], with these safety guidelines"

**Why it backfires:** People ignore restrictive policies, use AI in shadow

**Fix:** Trust + guardrails approach. Enable AI use with clear boundaries.

---

**Mistake 2: Too Vague (Unclear Guidance)**
❌ "Use AI responsibly"
✅ "Don't share customer names or emails in AI. Here are 5 examples..."

**Why it backfires:** People don't know what "responsible" means

**Fix:** Specific examples, clear do's and don'ts, practical checklists.

---

**Mistake 3: Too Long (No One Reads It)**
❌ 15-page policy with legal jargon
✅ 2-3 page policy in plain language + quick reference card

**Why it backfires:** Policy sits unread in shared drive

**Fix:** Be concise. Use examples. Provide checklists. Make it scannable.

---

**Mistake 4: Set and Forget (Never Updated)**
❌ Created in 2023, never touched again
✅ Reviewed quarterly, updated as AI tools evolve

**Why it backfires:** Policy becomes outdated and irrelevant

**Fix:** Schedule quarterly reviews. Gather ongoing feedback. Update as needed.

---

**Mistake 5: No Enforcement (Toothless)**
❌ Policy exists but violations have no consequences
✅ Clear accountability + progressive discipline + coaching

**Why it backfires:** Policy becomes a suggestion, not a standard

**Fix:** Document violations, provide coaching, escalate if needed. But start with education.

---

**Mistake 6: No Training (Assumed Understanding)**
❌ Email policy to team, assume they read and understand
✅ Run training session, provide resources, answer questions

**Why it backfires:** People don't understand policy or why it matters

**Fix:** Invest in training. Make it engaging. Provide ongoing support.

---

### [6:00-6:45] FOR SOLOPRENEURS & FREELANCERS

**"But I'm just one person. Do I really need a policy?"**

**Yes. Here's your simplified version:**

**Your Personal AI Policy (1 page):**

1. **Tools I use:** [ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro]
2. **Data I NEVER share:** Client names, credentials, proprietary info
3. **Before I publish AI content:** Fact-check, verify sources, edit for quality
4. **Client communication:** Disclose AI use when creating deliverables
5. **If client asks about AI use:** Be transparent about process and quality control

**Why this matters for freelancers:**
- Builds client trust (you have standards)
- Protects client data (NDA compliance)
- Differentiates you (professionalism)
- Legal protection (showing due diligence)

**Bonus:** Share your policy with clients → competitive advantage.

"I use AI to work faster while maintaining these strict quality and security standards."

---
